Whelm is a +3 warhammer of dwarven manufacture. In the hands of a dwarf, its enhancement bonus increases to +5, and it can be thrown with a 30-foot range increment. It returns to its thrower on the round after it was thrown and is then ready to be wielded or thrown again. When hurled, it deals +1d8 points of bonus damage or +2d8 points of bonus damage against giants. Whelm has three primary powers: detect secret doors at will, detect evil at will, and locate object in a 120-foot radius at will. Whelm can communicate telepathically, and it speaks and reads Common, Dwarven, Giant, Gnome, and Goblin.

Whelm’s special purpose is to destroy goblinoids and giants. Once per day, when struck upon the ground in pursuit of that goal, Whelm sends forth a shock wave that forces all creatures within 30 feet to make successful Fortitude saves (DC 18) or be stunned for 1d4 rounds.

Whelm bears a minor curse: One day after first using the weapon in battle, the wielder becomes agoraphobic, dreading open, outdoor spaces. The character takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks in outdoor settings. For each consecutive 24-hour period during which the wielder fails to spend at least 8 hours indoors or underground, this penalty increases by –1, to a maximum of –5. This condition persists until the wielder disposes of Whelm permanently.
