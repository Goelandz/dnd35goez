Personality: Originally called Razorleaf, this sword was renamed shortly after the death of its creator, an elf crusader who dedicated his life to fighting tyranny. A champion and advisor of many kings, Barsolidor succeeded in imprinting fragments of his life experience on the blade before his death. The sword vehemently opposes tyranny and slavery, and when its current wielder grows too old to fight, it asks to be passed on to a younger champion of good who shares its purpose and ideals.
