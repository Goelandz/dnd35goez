A black pearl on a light silver chain, this amulet appears to be a periapt of Wisdom +6 and functions as such until the wearer attempts a Spot or Listen check. At that moment and thereafter, the periapt imposes a –6 penalty on the wearer’s Wisdom.

Once the curse is activated, a periapt of oblivion can be removed only by means of a remove curse spell.
