Several of the prestige classes described in Chapter 3 allow a member of that class to select a third domain, which gives an additional granted power and offers one more spell option for the character to choose as a domain spell. This domain can be one of the standard domains available to clerics of the character's patron deity, or it can be one of the prestige domains described below. These domains are only available to characters entering a prestige class that allows selection of a third domain; they are not available to newly created characters.

If a noncleric enters a prestige class that allows access to a prestige domain, the character generally does gain access to the domain. She can use the granted power bestowed by the domain normally. If she is a divine spellcaster (a paladin, ranger, or druid), each day she can cast one extra spell of each spell level to which she normally has access, which must be the spell from the prestige domain for that level. If she is an arcane spellcaster (wizard, sorcerer, or bard), the domain spells are added to her spells known—scribed in a wizard's spellbook, or added to a sorcerer or bard's list of known spells, in addition to the character's normal number.
