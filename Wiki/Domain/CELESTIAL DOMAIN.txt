CELESTIAL DOMAIN

Deities: Domiel, Pistis Sophia.

Granted Power: You gain the supernatural ability to smite evil once per day. Add a +4 bonus to your melee attack roll and your cleric level to your damage. You must declare the smite before making the attack, and the attempt is wasted if the target is not evil.
