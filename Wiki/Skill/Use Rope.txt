USE ROPE (DEX)
With this skill, you can make firm knots, undo tricky knots, and bind prisoners with ropes. 

Check: Most tasks with a rope are relatively simple. The DCs for various tasks utilizing this skill are summarized on the table below. 

DC 	Task 
10 	Tie a firm knot 
10	Secure a grappling hook 
15 	Tie a special knot, such as one that slips, slides slowly, or loosens with a tug 
15 	Tie a rope around yourself one-handed 
15 	Splice two ropes together 
Varies	Bind a character 

Secure a Grappling Hook: Securing a grappling hook requires a Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 for every 10 feet of distance the grappling hook is thrown, to a maximum DC of 20 at 50 feet). Failure by 4 or less indicates that the hook fails to catch and falls, allowing you to try again. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the grappling hook initially holds, but comes loose after 1d4 rounds of supporting weight. Your DM should make this check secretly, so that you don’t know whether the rope will hold your weight. 

Bind a Character: When you bind another character with a rope, any Escape Artist check that the bound character makes is opposed by your Use Rope check. You get a +10 bonus on this check because it is easier to bind someone than to escape from bonds. You don’t even make your Use Rope check until someone tries to escape. 

Action: Varies. Throwing a grappling hook is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Tying a knot, tying a special knot, or tying a rope around yourself one-handed is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Splicing two ropes together takes 5 minutes. Binding a character takes 1 minute. 

=====Expanded Skill=====

You can tie knots more quickly than normal.

Quick Knot-Tying: You can try to tie a knot, a special knot, or a rope around yourself more quickly than normal. By accepting a –10 penalty on your Use Rope check, you can accomplish any one of these tasks as a move action (rather than a full-round action).
