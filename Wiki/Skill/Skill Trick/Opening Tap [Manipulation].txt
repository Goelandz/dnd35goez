“No time to waste on tools—a sharp tap should pop that lock!”

Prerequisite: Open Lock 12 ranks.

Benefit: As a swift action, you can make an Open Lock check with a –10 penalty by tapping a lock with a hard, blunt object such as the pommel of a weapon. You don’t take any additional penalty for making the check without thieves’ tools.

You can use this trick any number of times per day until you fail an Open Lock check made in this way. After a failure, you can’t use Opening Tap again until after you have rested for 8 hours.
