GATHER INFORMATION (CHA)
Use this skill for making contacts in an area, finding out local gossip, rumormongering, and collecting general information. 

Check: An evening’s time, a few gold pieces for buying drinks and making friends, and a DC 10 Gather Information check get you a general idea of a city’s major news items, assuming there are no obvious reasons why the information would be withheld. (Such reasons might include racial enmity—if you are an elf hanging out in an orc city, for example—or your inability to speak the local language.) The higher your check result, the better the information. 

If you want to find out about a specific rumor (“Which way to the ruined temple of Erythnul?”) or a specific item (“What can you tell me about that pretty sword the captain of the guard walks around with?”), or obtain a map, or do something else along those lines, the DC for the check is 15 to 25, or even higher. 

Who's who: Wily adventurers always know whom they deal with before committing to an agreement. Was the cloaked stranger who just hired your adventuring party really the duke's steward, and if so, does he really have his master's trust?

Find out who is really in charge: You need help from the Temple of the Four Winds, but do not know whom to ask. Should you approach the Grand Master himself, or should you ask one of his many underlings for aid? Proper use of this skill can help you find out who makes important decisions.

Action: A typical Gather Information check takes 1d4+1 hours. 

Try Again: Yes, but it takes time for each check. Furthermore, you may draw attention to yourself if you repeatedly pursue a certain type of information.
