Goddess of hearth and home, Estanna is called the Hearthtender or the Virgin. She is depicted as a young woman dressed in commoner’s garb, often cooking. Estanna’s faith teaches the simple virtues of home and family life. She is revered in many good households, honored at the lighting of the hearthfire even by people who are otherwise entirely devoted to a single deity or none at all. She is neutral good.

Estanna has very few clerics, and needs no more than that. People worship her without any need for intermediaries, and she has no overarching agenda that requires a large force of mortal agents doing her work on the Material Plane. A very few clerics serve her exclusively, ministering to commoners in their homes and offering services from curing to midwifery, rather than any actual priestly function. There are no temples devoted to Estanna, since she is properly worshiped only in the home.

The domains Estanna is associated with are Community, Good, and Protection.

Her symbol is a hearth and her favored weapon is the dagger.
