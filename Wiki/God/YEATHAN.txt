God of the evil depths, master of the last gasping breath, and lord of the deep darkness, Yeathan is a god of the sea. Once a simple water deity, Yeathan gradually brooded on darker, more mysterious matters until he became a neutral evil god of all things foul and malevolent about the sea. Some sahuagin, a few kuo-toas, and a fair number of aboleths and their skum servants revere Yeathan, who is largely unknown among land-dwellers.

Yeathan’s temples are always submerged and unlighted, filled with sharks, octopi, and strange denizens usually found in only the deepest undersea trenches. His symbol is a dark bluish-green spiral with a black center.  Yeathan is neutral evil.

Clerics of Yeathan are quiet, brooding individuals with quick tempers. They wear dark green and black. If they are not native water-breathers, they are nevertheless accomplished swimmers

Yeathan is associated with the Evil, Destruction, and Water domains.

His favored weapon is the trident.
