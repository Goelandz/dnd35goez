The Lady of Fate, Istus is a powerful deity who takes an abstract interest in the destinies of mortal and immortal alike. She carries a golden spindle with which she weaves the strands of fate together, spinning the future into the present. Her clerics use divination spells to try to discern what fate will bring, then they celebrate or warn their followers accordingly.
