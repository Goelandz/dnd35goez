While Osprem is the goddess of sea voyages, Procan is the god of the sea-storm, and his hurricanes and typhoons often threaten Osprem’s clerics. Procan—and by extension any cleric of his—is as mercurial in temperament as the sea itself, alternating between wrath and calm. His clerics are few, but anyone who makes their livelihood from the sea gives them a great deal of respect. Many are the tales of unlucky sailors who spurned a cleric of Procan, then set sail and never returned.
