Depicted as a young woman with a clay water jug, Geshtai is revered by farmers who rely on irrigation and river-travelers of all alignments. When rains swell a river to overfl owing, almost everyone living on the riverbank pleads with Geshtai for succor. Her clerics preach that the highest good is to live a tranquil existence that drifts inexorably from birth toward death.
