With every fi ber of his being, Tharizdun craves nothing less than the unmaking of the universe, destroying everything—himself included—in the process. Accordingly, the other gods imprisoned him away beyond the bounds of the universe he wants to destroy. But Tharizdun’s cults still persist, seeking ways to communicate with their dark master and free him to wreak havoc once more. Most of his clerics are insane, believing that Tharizdun will give them positions of power in the new universe he intends to create when he’s destroyed this one. In the meantime, they perform rites unspeakable even by the standards of other evil deities and seek out new forms of magic wherever they can.

 Despite his imprisonment, Tharizdun can still grant spells to the mad cultists who work in his name.
