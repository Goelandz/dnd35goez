Alignment: Chaotic Evil

Also known as the Shunned One, Nadi-rech is called the deity of cowardice by some and the god of trickery and luck by others. Followers of Valkar deride Nadirech’s worshipers for their lack of valor, while the faithful of Lyris dispute Nadirech’s claim to be a deity of luck. The clerics of Nadirech pray for spells at midnight, and usually in secrecy.
