During the long years in which a powerful necromancer lies decaying in his tomb, some of the magic that infused his bones seeps into the surrounding walls. If one of these stones is then shattered in a particular way, the resulting dust sometimes retains that power. When used as a component in the casting of any spell that targets either corpses or undead, this powder increases both the save DC and the caster level by 1.

Price: 15O gp.
