These small, translucent stones seem a little warm to the touch. They also at least faintly resemble an eye with a vivid red sclera, a white or yellow iris, and a black, catlike pupil. Despite the name, devil's eyes are natural crystals found in volcanic areas, often streambeds or collections of glacial debris. The warm feeling comes from a weak acid that forms on the stone's surface.

When a devil's eye is used in a divination spell, the spell's level is increased by one (as if by Heighten Spell).
