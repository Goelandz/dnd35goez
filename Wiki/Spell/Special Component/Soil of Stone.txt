Taken from beneath the palaces of the dao (genie's of Elemental Earth), this powdered stone retains traces of both that plane and its masters. If this so-called soil of stone is used as a component in the casting of any Earth domain spell or a spell that has the earth descriptor, it doubles the duration. 

Price: 65 gp.
