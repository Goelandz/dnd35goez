Gold dragons like to feast on pearls and gems. Occasionally, a few gems pass through such a dragon's system undigested. If one of those gems is a ruby, it absorbs a bit of the creature's fiery nature and becomes a dragon ruby. When used as a component in the casting of any spell that has the fire descriptor, a dragon ruby doubles that spell's area. 

Price: 175 gp.
