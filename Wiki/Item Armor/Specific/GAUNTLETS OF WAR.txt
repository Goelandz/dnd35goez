These simple metal gauntlets are the type that normally comes with a suit of full plate armor, though they are abnormally well polished. Symbols of war are etched deeply across the back of each. 

While you wear gauntlets of war, you gain a +1 bonus on melee weapon damage. If you worship any deity that grants access to the War domain, this bonus increases to +3 with that deity's favored weapon. 

Cost to Create: 2, 000 gp, 160 XP, 4 days.
