This tiny ring is carved of smooth wood, and engravings of ivy run along its length. 

Whenever you cast a summon nature's ally spell (whether normally or spontaneously), you can treat it as though it were one level higher than it is. For instance, if you cast summon nature's ally III (or sacrifice a 3rd-level druid spell to spontaneously cast it), you can treat it as if you had cast summon nature's ally IV instead. However, you cannot use a ring of the beast to cast a summon nature's ally spell of a level higher than you can normally cast (in the class that allows you to cast the summon nature's ally spell). This ring continues to function even while you are using wild shape. 

The ring of the beast is part of a set collectively known as the trappings of the beast. When you wear it along with armor of the beast (page 135) and a mantle of the beast (see above), you gain additional abilities, as noted in the armor of the beast description.
 
Cost to Create: 4, 000 gp, 320 XP, 8 days.
