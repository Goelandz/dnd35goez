This heavy cloak is made of a rough, gray fur from some unidentifiable creature. 

The mantle of the beast allows you to use your wild shape ability as a swift action. While wild shaped, your natural weapons gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. 

A mantle of the beast is part of a set known collectively as the trappings of the beast, which also includes the armor of the beast (page 135) and the ring of the beast (see below). When you wear all three items together, you gain additional abilities, as noted in the description of armor of the beast. 

Cost to Create: 9, 000 gp, 720 XP, 18 days.
