This +3 banded mail was created to assist brave adventurers in the struggle against vampires. It is usually found in the armories of churches dedicated to vanquishing these bloodsuckers. Protective symbols from benevolent gods cover vampire hunter armor, which has noticeably thick neck protection.

On command, the armor produces daylight and protection from evil. Once per day, it can produce sunburst and holy smite as the spells from a 15th-level cleric. 

Vampire hunter armor grants a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against domination attempts. Energy drain attacks by vampires (and only vampires) are reduced from two negative levels to one negative level. Vampire hunter armor also has armbands made of wood that can “grow” wooden stakes that appear against the upper arm. These can be removed and used as +1 weapons (1d3 damage, threat range 19–20, piercing). It takes a full-round action to regrow a stake once it has been removed from an armband.

The armor bestows one negative level on any nongood creature wearing it. This negative level persists as long as the armor is worn and disappears when the armor is removed. The negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the armor is worn.
