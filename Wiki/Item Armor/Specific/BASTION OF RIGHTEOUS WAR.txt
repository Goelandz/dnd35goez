The border of this chevron-shaped shield is emblazoned with symbols of warfare. When it is carried, the image of a deity's holy symbol forms in the center. 

This +1 heavy steel shield functions best in the hands of a cleric or paladin. If an enemy scores a critical threat against you, you can expend a turn or rebuke undead attempt as an immediate action to negate the critical threat. You must make this decision before your opponent rolls to confirm the critical threat, and you still take the normal damage from the attack. The cost (in turn/rebuke attempts) to activate the bastion of righteous war increases by 1 for every additional multiple of damage (beyond x2) that would normally be dealt by the attack's critical hit. For example, negating a critical threat from a heavy pick (which deals four times normal damage on a critical hit) would cost three turn/rebuke undead attempts, rather than one. 

The bastion of righteous war is part of a set known collectively as the regalia of righteous war, which also includes the blade of righteous war (see below) and the helm of righteous war (page 139). When you hold this blade while wearing the other items in the set, you can spend a turn/rebuke undead attempt as an immediate action to make an attack of opportunity with the blade against any foe that successfully strikes an ally in melee combat, even if you have already made one against that opponent that round. (You must threaten the foe in order to make this attack of opportunity. ) 

The holy symbol pictured on the shield always matches the deity worshiped by the wearer (if any).
