Dwarf armorsmiths grow dendritic armor from seed crystals deep underground; dendritic armor never reaches the smith’s fire. Each suit of dendritic armor is tailored for a specific wearer. This superb armor is socketed rather than riveted together, leaving almost no gaps or chinks. It protects better than full plate armor, but is also heavier and more cumbersome.

Dendritic armor constantly grinds crystal flecks off, and regrows itself to its original shape. Anyone tracking a person wearing dendritic armor gains a +2 circumstance bonus on skill checks from the fine trail of crystals left behind. To remove dendritic armor, you must break your way out by succeeding at a Strength check (DC 25). As long as you leave at least 5 pounds of dendritic armor somewhere on your body, the armor grows back in 8 hours.
