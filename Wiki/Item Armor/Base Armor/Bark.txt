This armor is carefully crafted from the tough bark of ancient trees and is treated to prevent it from becoming brittle over time. Strips of bark are layered together over a quilted layer of felt or hide. Bark armor is more flexible than wooden armor but does not provide as much protection. Druids can wear bark armor without losing access to their spells and class features. Bark armor includes arm, leg, chest, and back protection, but it does not include gauntlets.
