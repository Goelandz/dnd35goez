This buckler is actually a Tiny scarab beetle that latches onto the forearm. You must wear the beetle for a full day before the beetle buckler confers any bonus to Armor Class. Once it’s attuned to its wearer, the beetle buckler is effectively a masterwork buckler with a nonmagical +1 enhancement bonus to Armor Class.

With a command word, you can detach the beetle. Then the beetle takes wing, darting around your body and blocking ranged attacks (as the Deflect Arrows feat, but using the beetle’s Reflex save bonus, not your own). The beetle cannot be ordered to attack, but it defends itself if attacked.
