Buffering armor and buffering shields are always dull black, and they appear to possess depths that couldn’t exist. A suit of armor or a shield with this quality absorbs ability-draining and level-draining attacks. It can absorb as many points of ability damage or levels drained per day as its enhancement bonus. It also allows Fortitude saves against energydrain attacks that normally don’t allow such saves. A successful save halves the effect. Buffering armor and buffering shields do not change saves against attacks that already allow them.
