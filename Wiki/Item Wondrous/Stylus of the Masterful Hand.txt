This elegant but sturdy metal stylus grants +5 competence bonus on Forgery checks. On command, the stylus can also “remember” up to three different types of handwriting, which allows another Forgery attempt without having to make a roll—the DC of that handwriting is “fixed” at whatever was rolled during the attempt.
