Common to plains and savannas, the sluggish torch bug looks like a bloated firefly. The insect’s bulbous abdomen, nearly the size of a child’s fist, accounts for more than half its body. When torch bugs are agitated, or during their lengthy mating season, their abdomens glow with a warm, yellow light. Inhabitants of areas thick with torch bugs harvest the sluggish insects for a variety of purposes.

==============================================================

Bladders made from severed torch bug abdomens are sold for the strange mixture of chemicals that grant the insects their glow. Each contains one application of the luminescent slime known as torch bug paste. These bladders do not shed light, and the paste within does not begin glowing until exposed to air.Torch bug paste can be applied to inanimate objects or living creatures. One bladder contains enough paste to paint up to a 10-foot-square area; a full-round action is required per 5-foot square covered.A treated area glows for 1 hour and sheds as much light as a torch (emanating bright light out to 20 feet and shadowy illumination for another 20 feet beyond that). Torch bug paste makes a painted object highly visible, and it is often used as a temporary decoration or to mark targets in the dark. It can be used to write short words or simple symbols, but these marks must be rather large, since the paste’s glow obscures details.

  A bladder of torch bug paste can also be thrown as a splash weapon (PH 158). Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A bladder of torch bug paste bursts upon striking a firm surface, covering the target and every adjacent creature or item with the glowing chemical. Creatures struck by the paste are ffected as if by a faerie fire spell for 1 hour. This effect is not magical and cannot be dispelled. Torch bug paste can be washed away from a creature or a 5-foot square as a full-round action but requires at least 1 gallon of water.
