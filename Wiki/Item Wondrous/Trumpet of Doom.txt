This small brass trumpet is engraved with interwoven patterns of feathers and flames. The trumpet emits a haunting blare that fills evil enemies with a terrible sense of dread. All evil creatures within 100 feet that can hear the trumpet’s blare are shaken for 1 minute (DC 14 Will save negates). The trumpet can be blown up to three times per day.
