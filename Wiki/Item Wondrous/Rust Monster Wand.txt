The skittering larval young of rust monsters are just as insatiable as adults when it comes to ferrous metals. Little more than 1 inch long and bristling with underdeveloped armor and appendages, these nuisances have the same rusting ability as mature rust monsters, their whiplike antennae ever probing for the touch of metal. Some clever thieves have figured out that these creatures can be helpful when carefully harnessed in a suitable container.

Such a container, commonly called a rust monster wand, is a 1-foot-long piece of glass tubing about 4 inches in diameter that contains about a dozen rust monster larvae. One end of the tube is sealed shut, and the other one is fitted with a two-layer wooden cap. The outer layer of this top covers the wand’s end; when closed, it prevents the larvae from touching anything outside the wand. The inside layer is a thin latticework that keeps the immature aberrations inside the tube but allows their antennae to extend through the holes in the lattice. Uncapping the solid cover and running the tip of the wand across a metal surface allows the hungry young to slowly but effectively eat through metal objects or barriers. The rust monster larvae in a wand can ruin a Large weapon or suit of armor (or a metal object of similar size) in 1 minute, a Medium weapon or suit of armor in 9 rounds, or a Small weapon or suit of armor in 6 rounds.The wand is brittle and must be applied to a target rather delicately, so it cannot be used as a weapon.

The larvae within a rust monster wand can survive for about 2 months if given air (by opening the outer layer of the end cap) and fed the equivalent of five coins of metal (or more) per day.

If removed from the wand, individual larvae do not have the size or ability to do appreciable harm to metal equipment. One of these creatures by itself has 1 hit point and can be crushed as a standard action.
