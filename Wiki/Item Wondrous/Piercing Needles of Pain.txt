These three needles must be used together to gain any effect. If all three pierce the flesh of a creature (each dealing 1 point of damage that can’t be healed until it is removed), the pained creature can give feelings of intense pain to others by touch. The painful touch produces the effect of a wrack spell (Fort DC 15 negates).
