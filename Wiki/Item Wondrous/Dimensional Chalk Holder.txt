This small, elaborately carved silver tube is designed to hold a single piece of normal chalk. On mental command, the user can “draw” in the air, which leaves behind a vibrant blue line of crackling energy. Once a complete circle has been formed, the enclosed space suddenly disappears, creating a gate to wherever the user wishes. It only allows the planar travel aspect of the gate spell, not the ability to call forth creatures. 

The item allows its user to draw only a circle. The user can feel it resisting anything but a curved line. There is no size limit to the circle, but it must be completely drawn in 1 full round to create the gate. 

The dimensional chalk holder can draw 1d4+1 gates before crumbling into dust. Drawing a line counts as one use, regardless of whether a complete circle was made or not.
