 This moon-sliver symbol is always silver in color and often decoated with etched or embossed images of leaves, berries, and nuts. Worshipers of the Protector keep these items highly polished so that they shine brightly in moonlight. 

When displayed while casting Protection domain or abjuration spells, a silver badge of Larethian increases your effective caster level by 1.
