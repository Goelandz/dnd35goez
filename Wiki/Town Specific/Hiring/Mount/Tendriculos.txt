The only known way to train a tendriculos is to raise it from a seed, grown in a special mixture that negates its paralytic digestive juices. This makes the tendriculos completely dependent on its master, since it can no longer digest food. The tendriculos needs someone to feed it pulped meat. If left alone, it starves.

With its digestive acids so neutralized, the stomach of a tendriculos is a perfect niche for riders and cargo. A device resembling a bear trap serves as a bridle to lock the tendriculos’s jaws open or shut (for the rider’s visibility or protection, respectively), and to provide contact points for reins. With this device activated, the tendriculos cannot use its bite attack.

In training, the tendriculos is taught not to swallow enemies whole, since that puts an enemy inside with the rider. However, these savage plants get carried away. In battle, a rider must make a successful Ride check (DC 20) to control this swallowing instinct the first time a tendriculos grabs a creature.
