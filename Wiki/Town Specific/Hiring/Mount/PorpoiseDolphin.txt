quatic races of all kinds ride porpoises. Rather than saddling the porpoise, riders wear seaweed twisted into a harness. Then they slide loops of braided seaweed around the porpoise’s nose as a bridle and connect these to the harness. This harness grants the same benefits as a military saddle.

Porpoises are an exception to the normal size restrictions for mounts. Thanks to the buoyancy of water, Medium-size creatures can ride porpoises. There is no room for passengers. Porpoises become encumbered quickly, so riders try to shed unnecessary pounds.

Though distinct creatures, porpoises and dolphins are similar enough to share the same statistics.
