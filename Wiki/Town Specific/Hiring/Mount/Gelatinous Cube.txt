Gelatinous cubes are not mounts for the faint of heart, or for those in a particular hurry. Bizarre “cavalry” in Underdark wars, gelatinous cubes are used to herd opposing troops and chew through defensive lines, or to protect valuable spellcasters after their magic is spent.

Cube riders require special gear just to survive the ride. The “saddle” for a cube is a special magic item, an amulet of ooze riding (see the sidebar). The amulet activates a force sphere whenever the wearer comes in contact with an ooze. Then, with some effort, the rider nudges the sphere to the center of the cube and rides safely inside. It takes 1 minute to fully mount or dismount a gelatinous cube; once inside, a cube rider can’t be dislodged by any normal means. Ride checks incur a –5 circumstance penalty if the rider is not fully mounted.

Gelatinous cubes are air-permeable, so breathing is never an issue. However, carrying a rider disorients a cube’s ability to find prey by scent—everything smells like food when an organic creature occupies its center. Denied their sense of smell, occupied cubes sense prey solely through vibration.

Although cubes are nonintelligent (and therefore untrainable), they can be directed. “Steering” a gelatinous cube is an odd art. Taking advantage of the cube’s impaired senses, a rider creates vibrations within its mass by banging on the force sphere. With practice, specific vibrations can fool the cube into sensing external movement. Thus, the cube continually chases phantom “food” in the direction the rider indicates.

A rider must exit his cube at a decent speed (at least faster than the cube’s land speed of 15 feet), since the cube immediately tries to engulf any food that suddenly appears near it.
