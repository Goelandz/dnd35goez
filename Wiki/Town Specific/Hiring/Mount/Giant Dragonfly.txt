Raiders and bandits who ride flying vermin prefer giant dragonflies to other mounts. They’re less aggressive than wasps but more so than bees. They also make a distinct thrumming sound in flight that strikes fear into common folk. 

Riders prefer to use female dragonflies, since males are very territorial. A giant dragonfly is 10 feet long with a 10-foot wingspan. Its body is only 2 feet wide.

Training a Giant Dragonfly: Training a giant dragonfly as a mount requires a successful Handle Animal check (DC 30). Giant dragonfly eggs are worth 500 gp on the open market. Professional trainers charge 300 gp to tame a giant dragonfly.

Riding a giant dragonfly requires an exotic saddle. A giant dragonfly can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

Carrying Capacity: Light 300 lb., medium 600 lb., heavy 900 lb.
