These magical beasts are guardians for the fashionably rich. Because of their habitat preference, clutches or whole colonies of shocker lizards are placed in the gardens and inner courtyards of expensive houses to guard against the inevitable thief who tries entry under cover of heavy foliage. Others keep shocker lizards as personal protection, wearing them on their shoulders like exotic pets, or walking a pair of them on short leashes while out and about.

Trainers usually teach household shocker lizards not to attack children or favored servants. Vindictive owners, though, sometimes have them trained not to emit their customary warning clicks before attacking.
