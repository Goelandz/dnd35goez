For castles built on ocean cliffs, royal yachts out on pleasure cruises, or underwater treasure grottoes, sea lions make excellent guardians. Sea lion trainers are usually locathahs or merfolk; land dwellers are at too great a disadvantage in attempting to soothe and teach these ferocious predators. Because of their fighting tactics and disposition, sea lions are best kept and trained in prides. They cannot be domesticated.
