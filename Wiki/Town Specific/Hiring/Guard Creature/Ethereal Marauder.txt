Only a very few ethereal marauders have been caught, fewer trained, and none domesticated.
They are exceptional guards, but perhaps not worth the effort. Trainers who wish to try anyway must first arrange a method of trapping an ethereal marauder on the Material Plane—usually by means of a magic item such as a collar of material entrapment (see the sidebar). Then they must locate one of these creatures. This in itself has been the subject of years-long quests; kings and rich merchants have arranged ethereal expeditions in fruitless attempts to capture one of these predators.

The problems do not end once the creature has been captured. Little is known about their ecology, and many ethereal marauders mysteriously die in captivity. Further, not only is the concept of training foreign to them, they don’t even understand language as it is known on the Material Plane. The trainer (or some interested party) must either use some form of telepathy or make a successful Innuendo check (DC 25) to communicate the meaning of all the bewildering behavior to the creature.

Happily, once this is done, an ethereal marauder turns out to be surprisingly intelligent, and if convinced to submit, serves its master faithfully. It quickly learns nearly any trick and performs them all well. As guards, ethereal marauders usually remain on the Ethereal Plane, watching their charge intently and attacking interlopers ruthlessly.
