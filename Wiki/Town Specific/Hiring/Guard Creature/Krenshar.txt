Though krenshars adapt well to civilized habitats, they still play hunting games with each other and
their masters when off duty. Playful krenshars try to jump out and scare their masters as often as possible.
Masters attribute numerous gray hairs to this “play.” 

Due to their social natures, krenshars prefer to stay among their own kind even when domesticated. A solitary domesticated krenshar must be kept constantly socialized or it becomes jittery and its skin tightens, reducing the effectiveness of its
scare ability (it no longer gets the +3 bonus on Bluff checks).
