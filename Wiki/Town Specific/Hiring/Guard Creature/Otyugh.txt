A favorite entrance for thieves into an otherwise well-guarded fortification is through the garbage chute or sewers. It happens so often, one would think all the rich and powerful would take this into account. Those who keep guard otyughs do.

Even untrained, otyughs sometimes enter symbiotic relationships with other beings, not attacking if fed regularly and left alone in their refuse. Trained otyughs are smart enough not only to refrain from attacking their benefactors, but also to accept complex instructions about whom to attack, when, and how. They can listen for passwords or musical phrases, look
for identifying insignia, or follow specific verbal instructions such as “Attack anyone except Baron Roquefort and his retinue or Stephen the dung boy, and don’t attack anyone for an hour after sunrise.”
