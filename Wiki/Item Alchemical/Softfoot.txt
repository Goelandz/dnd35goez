Softfoot is a fine gray powder that muffles sound when applied to the bottom of a foot or boot. It provides a +1 alchemical bonus on Move Silently checks for 1 hour.

 One dose of softfoot is enough to affect one Medium creature that has one pair of feet; each additional pair of feet (or similar appendages) requires another dose. Applying softfoot is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. If softfoot is applied over a boot or other foot covering, its benefit is lost if the foot covering is removed. Likewise, if it is applied to a creature’s skin or hide, its benefit is lost if the creature later dons footwear.
