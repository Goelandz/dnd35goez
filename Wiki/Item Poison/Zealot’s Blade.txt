This venom incorporates the blood of its intended target, making it even deadlier to such creatures. A tool of hunters and assassins who stalk specific targets, each dose of zealot’s blade is brewed for a specific type or subtype of creatures. When creating zealot’s blade, the poisonmaker must choose a type (and subtype, if applicable) from Table 3–14: Ranger Favored Enemies on page 47 of the Player’s Handbook. Any creature not of the chosen type or subtype gains a +5 bonus on saves to resist the poison’s effect.
