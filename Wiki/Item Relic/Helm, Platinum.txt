This smooth helm covers threequarters of the face and is decorated with a dragon-wing motif. 

The original platinum helms were given to seven gold dragons that acted as Bahamut’s consorts, but they have since passed to his servants on the Material Plane. Anyone who wears a platinum helm has the frightful presence of a dragon, potentially affecting everyone with fewer Hit Dice within a 150-foot radius. Whenever the wearer of the platinum helm attacks, foes must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 +1/2 wearer’s HD + wearer’s Cha modifier) or be panicked (foes of 4 or less HD) or shaken (foes of 5 or more HD) for 4d6 rounds. The wearer also gains blindsense with a 60-foot range.

To use this relic, you must worship Bahamut and either sacrifice an 8thlevel divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 15 HD.
