This shield’s provenance is unrecorded, but it is named for the gory, dripping hand emblazoned on it. The shield of the severed hand is a +4 heavy wooden shield that gives its wielder a free bull-rush attempt at a +4 bonus once per round when the shield is struck in melee by a foe (in other words, when the +6 bonus from the shield was the difference between hitting and missing). When the foe hits the shield, make an immediate bull rush attempt, even if it isn’t your turn; you can follow the opponent who gets pushed back if you wish. You can’t fall prone during this attempt.

To use this relic, you must worship Gruumsh and either sacrifi ce a 4th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 7 HD.
