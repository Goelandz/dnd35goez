Legend says these arrows (there are reputedly fi ve) gained relic status when Ehlonna used them to slay a great wyrm green dragon that was rampaging through a forest primeval. A raptor arrow is a +3 arrow with a variant of the returning quality. At the beginning of the round after it is fi red from a bow, a raptor arrow wrenches itself from whatever it hit (dealing 1d8 points of damage), fl ies up to 400 feet 

through the air, and restrings itself in the bow from which it was fi red. Unlike most ammunition, raptor arrows are never destroyed when they hit their target.

If a ranger fi res a raptor arrow at a favored enemy, the arrow additionally gains the bane quality against that foe.

To use this relic, you must worship Ehlonna and either sacrifi ce a 6th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat.
