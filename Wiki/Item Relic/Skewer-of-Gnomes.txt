This Small +3 unholy gnomebane spear is quasi-sentient and can ready itself against a charge, attacking (and dealing double damage) automatically whenever a foe charges the wielder. The attack uses the wielder’s highest base attack bonus and all relevant modifi ers, just as if the wielder were making an attack of opportunity.

To use this relic, you must worship Kurtulmak and either sacrifi ce a 7th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 13 HD.
