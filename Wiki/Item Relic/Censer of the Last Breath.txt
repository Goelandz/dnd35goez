Nerull’s favorite followers fill this censer, a perforated iron ball on a jeweled chain, with ground-up gems rather than incense. Doing so is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. 

The censer of the last breath then automatically starts burning the gem dust, creating a dangerous cloud that fills a 20-foot radius emanation centered on the caster. The cloud’s effects depend on the kind of gem dust burned in the censer of the last breath.

Gem type Value Effect
Diamond dust 250 gp Solid fog (as the spell, except that only living creatures are slowed)
Emerald dust 500 gp Cloudkill (as the spell, except that it hovers near caster; Fort partial DC 17)
Sapphire dust 1,000 gp Acid fog (as the spell, except that only living creatures are slowed)
Ruby dust 2,000 gp Incendiary cloud (as the spell, except that it hovers near caster; Reflex half DC 22)

The bearer of the censer of the last breath is completely unaffected by the cloud; it doesn’t slow movement, deal him damage, or obscure his vision.

The gem dust burns in the censer of the last breath for 15 rounds.

To use this relic, you must worship Nerull and either sacrifice an 8th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 15 HD.
