HYPOTHERMIA
Cold water can kill quite quickly through hypothermia (the loss of body heat), but surprisingly even water as warm as 70º F or 80º F can kill, given a few hours.

 Very cold water is water encountered while the air temperature is cold (40° F) or colder, water in any cold aquatic terrain, and water in deep subterranean lakes and rivers. Very cold water deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute of exposure. You can negate this damage with a successful Constitution check (DC 15, +1 
per previous check).
 Cold water is found in moderate air temperatures (40° to 60° F), in temperate aquatic terrain (except in summer), and in subterranean lakes and rivers that are relatively close to the surface in warm lands. Cold water deals 1d6 points 
of nonlethal damage per 10 minutes of exposure. You can negate this damage with a successful Constitution check 
(DC 12, +1 per previous check).

 Warm water is found when air temperatures are warm or hot (60º F or warmer) or in warm aquatic terrain. Warm water deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per hour of exposure. You can negate this damage with a successful Constitution check (DC 9, +1 per previous check).

 Creatures native to cold or temperate aquatic environments are immune to hypothermia brought about by exposure to warm, cold, or very cold water. Creatures native to warm aquatic environments are immune to hypothermia from warm or cold waters, and treat very cold water as cold water.
