This amulet provides a +2 sacred bonus to AC. In addition, when the wearer takes damage from a melee attack made with a natural or hand-held weapon, the damage is divided equally between the attacker and the target. If the damage is an odd number, the extra point of damage goes to the attacker.

The retributive amulet deals the same types of wounds upon the attacker that the wearer receives, but only damage to hit points. For example, a rogue who uses a poisoned dagger to stab the amulet’s wearer would receive an identical gash in the same spot as the wearer, but would not suffer ability loss from the weapon’s poison.

The amulet must be worn to function; it needs no command word for activation.
