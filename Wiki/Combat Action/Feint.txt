FEINT 
As a standard action, you can try to mislead an opponent in melee combat so that he can’t dodge your next attack effectively. To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by a Sense Motive check by your target. The target may add his base attack bonus to this Sense Motive check. If your Bluff check result exceeds your target’s Sense Motive check result, the next melee attack you make against the target does not allow him to use his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). This attack must be made on or before your next turn. 

Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because it’s harder to read a strange creature’s body language; you take a –4 penalty. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2), you take a 
–8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it’s impossible. Feinting in combat does not provoke attacks of opportunity. 

Feinting as a Move Action: With the Improved Feint feat, you can attempt a feint as a move action instead of as a standard action.
