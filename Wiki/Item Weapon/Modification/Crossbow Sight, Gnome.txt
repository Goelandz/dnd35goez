This device comes in two parts: an eyepiece that attaches to the stock of a crossbow and a sight that is affixed to the end of the weapon. When calibrated properly, the sights allow the user to focus more carefully on a target. The user treats targets as if they were two range increments closer. It has no effect on targets within the first two range increments.
