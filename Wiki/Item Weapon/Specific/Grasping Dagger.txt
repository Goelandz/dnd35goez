In addition to its main blade, this +3 keen punching dagger has two large barbs that project from the dagger’s hilt. On a successful critical hit, these barbs can hook into the target’s flesh, holding it fast. After a successful critical hit, the wielder may make a grapple attempt as a free action. If successful, the target is hooked on the dagger’s barbs. While grappling in this manner, the wielder can attack with the grasping dagger normally.
