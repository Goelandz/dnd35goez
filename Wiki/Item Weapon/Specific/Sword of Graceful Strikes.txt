This +3 short sword allows graceful wielders to deal extra damage based on agility, not brute force. All melee attacks made with the sword of graceful strikes add the wielder’s Dexterity modifier to damage rather than his Strength modifier. Furthermore, an unsuccessful disarm attempt made with the sword of graceful strikes does not allow the target a chance to disarm the wielder.
