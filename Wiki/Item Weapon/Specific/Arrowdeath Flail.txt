This +2/+1 dire flail provides excellent protection against projectile attacks. While holding an arrowdeath flail, the wielder can deflect projectiles and thrown weapons as if she had the Deflect Arrows feat. When taking the total defense action, an arrowdeath flail grants an additional +2 deflection bonus to Armor Class that applies only to ranged weapon attacks.
