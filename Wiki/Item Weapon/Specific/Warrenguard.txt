The hilt of this well-crafted +2 short sword has been shaped to resemble a heavily armored gnome soldier standing at attention. Small characters wielding warrenguard underground gain a +1 morale bonus on their melee attack damage for each ally within 5 feet. Warrenguard also helps its wielder coordinate blows with companions. If the wielder and an ally flank an opponent, the wielder of a warrenguard gains a +4 flanking bonus on his attack roll instead of the usual +2 bonus.
