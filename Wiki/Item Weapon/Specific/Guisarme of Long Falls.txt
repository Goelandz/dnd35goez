The curved blade at the end of this +2 guisarme is hooked even more than that of a normal guisarme and can cause particularly jarring falls. Whenever the wielder uses the guisarme of long falls to make a successful trip attempt, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 16) or be stunned for one round.
