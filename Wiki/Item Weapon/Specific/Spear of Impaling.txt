The barbed head of this +2 longspear holds foes fast once they have been run through. After a successful critical hit, the wielder of a spear of impaling may make a grapple attempt as a free action. If this grapple attempt succeeds, the wielder may then make a pin attempt as part of the same action. Grapples and pins caused by a spear of impaling can be broken normally. If a foe is grappled in this manner, but not pinned, the wielder can use subsequent attacks to attempt to deal damage or initiate a pin. Opponents grappled by a spear of impaling can make an opposed grapple check to break the pin and escape the grapple, but not to deal damage or initiate pins of their own.
