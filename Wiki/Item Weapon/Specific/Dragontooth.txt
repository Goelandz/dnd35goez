Made from a single tooth of an ancient blue dragon, this +2 shock rapier projects a fearsome aura around its wielder. Foes within 5 feet of the wielder must succeed on a Will save (DC 16)or suffer the effects of the fear spell from an 8th-level caster. Once foes have made a successful saving throw against the fear aura, they are immune to the aura’s effects for one day.
