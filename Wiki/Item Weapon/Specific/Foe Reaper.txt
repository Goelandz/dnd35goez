This +2 mighty cleaving scythe can cut through foes three at a time. During extra attacks granted by the Cleave feat or the scythe’s mighty cleaving ability, its threat range is doubled. Foe reaper is treated as a keen weapon for purposes of spells interacting with it, meaning it cannot be the target of keen edge or bless weapon, nor can it receive the vicious ability.
