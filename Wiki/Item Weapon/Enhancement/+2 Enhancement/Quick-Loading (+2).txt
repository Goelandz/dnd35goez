Only crossbows can have this ability. A quick-loading crossbow accesses an extradimensional space that can hold up to 100 bolts, allowing the wielder to reload the crossbow more rapidly than normal. Reloading a hand or light crossbow is a free action (allowing a character with multiple attacks to make a full attack), and reloading a heavy crossbow is a move-equivalent action. Adding a bolt to or removing one from the extradimensional space by hand requires a move-equivalent action. The extradimensional space can hold different types of bolts, and the wielder may select freely from these when reloading the crossbow.
