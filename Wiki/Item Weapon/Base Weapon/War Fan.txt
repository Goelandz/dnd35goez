This weapon appears to the untrained eye as nothing more than a beautifully crafted lady’s fan. In fact, the vanes of the fan are crafted from steel, and the tips are needle-sharp. When first entering melee using a war fan, you may attempt a Bluff check against an opponent’s Sense Motive check. If you win the contest, you gain a +4 bonus on attacks made against that foe during the first round of combat.
