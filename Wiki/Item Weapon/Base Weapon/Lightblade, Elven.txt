This rapierlike weapon is the size of a short sword, but weighs only as much as a dagger. Dexterous elf fi ghters and rogues favor it. Its thin, fl exible blade slips easily into the seams of armor or between the ribs of a foe. Some elf nobles carry a lightblade—often decorated with intricate filigree and tiny gemstones—as a sign of their station, even if they aren’t proficient in its use.
