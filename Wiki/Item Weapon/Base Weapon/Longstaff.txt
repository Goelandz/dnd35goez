As its name implies, the longstaff is a longer version of the quarterstaff. The extra length makes the weapon much more diffi cult to use, but those skilled in its use are better able to protect themselves from multiple attackers when fighting cautiously.

 If you are profi cient with the longstaff and you fi ght defensively or employ the total defense combat maneuver, you cannot be fl anked for the rest of the round. This benefit also applies if you are profi cient in the weapon, have the Combat Expertise feat, and shift at least 2 points of your attack bonus to AC for the round.

 A longstaff is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fi ghting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were fighting with a one-handed weapon and a light weapon (see TwoWeapon Fighting, page 160 of the Player’s Handbook). 

You can also strike with either end singly. A creature wielding a longstaff in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

 The longstaff is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a longstaff special options (see the flurry of blows description, page 40 of the Player’s Handbook).

 Characters proficient with the longstaff can treat it as a quarterstaff for the purpose of any of the following 

feats: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, and Weapon Specialization
