POISON
Many aquatic creatures are horribly venomous and produce deadly natural poisons. Some of these are commonly harvested by aquatic races and used against their foes. See the accompanying table.

 Inhaled poisons generally do not work underwater. However, one inhaled poison (yellow urchin extract) is a thick, milky fluid that is manufactured for use underwater.
