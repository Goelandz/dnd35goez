A capsule retainer consists of a thin, rubbery strap looped inside the teeth. The strap is fi tted with a small, smooth metal ring that can hold one alchemical capsule. The ring can be positioned on either the inside or outside of the user’s gums. Some users find that holding the ring inside the gum and keeping the capsule under the tongue is the most comfortable way to wear a capsule retainer, while others fi nd that holding the ring on the outside of the upper gum allows them to tuck the capsule in their cheek comfortably.
