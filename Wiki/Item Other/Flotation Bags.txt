These are inflatable animal bladders sewn to lightweight leather for strength. Flotation bags grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Swim checks to remain on the surface. The bags impose a –2 circumstance penalty on checks when underwater, as the swimmer has to fight the bags’ tendency to float. It takes a full round to inflate flotation bags and a standard action to deflate them.
