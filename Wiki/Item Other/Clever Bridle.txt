This bit-and-bridle set always looks clean and new. When worn by a horse, a clever bridle grants the ability to learn three, six, or nine more tricks than the horse could normally learn, depending on the version. The horse must wear the bridle for 8 hours per day to maintain any extra tricks it learns.
