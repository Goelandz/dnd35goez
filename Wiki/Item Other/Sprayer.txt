This is a small storage drum attached to a large handle and pump. The drum is filled with liquid, usually water, although oil and holy water are commonly used as well (acid is a poor choice, as it eats away the container in a few rounds). When pumped (a standard action) the sprayer creates a dense cloud of vapor 10 feet long. Because the particles are so fine, the cloud lasts for only a moment and does not drift to adjacent squares. The drum contains enough liquid to last for three pumps before needing to be refilled.
