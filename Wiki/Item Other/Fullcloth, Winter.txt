This is a heavily quilted undergarment that is worn underneath regular clothing to protect the wearer against cold. 

Winter fullcloth is considered part of the cold weather outfit described in the Player’s Handbook. If worn by itself, it grants a +1 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saving throws against exposure to cold weather (see Cold Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’S Guide).
