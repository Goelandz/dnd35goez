A typical drum consists of skin, parchment, or some similar material stretched tightly over the opening of a hollow wooden cylinder or pot. This covered opening is called the drumhead. Striking the drumhead with sticks, mallets, or even hands produces the sound. Some drums have only one drumhead; others have two or more. Drums exist in large varieties (such as kettle drums) as well as smaller varieties (such as bongo drums or the double-ended tabor).

Drums are popular with almost every race and culture for their ability to stir the emotions, establish a background beat for dancing, and provide counterpoint for a melody produced by some other instrument. Dwarves, orcs, and other races that favor underground living particularly enjoy the echoing power of drums. Smaller races, such as goblins and halflings, like bongo drums for their portability. The rare creatures that do not appreciate drum-playing include celestials, who consider drum rhythms primitive, and elves, who find them vaguely disturbing and annoying (a prejudice reinforced, perhaps, by the enthusiasm with which many of their enemies embrace them). 

Bardic Music: When a bard uses a drum to inspire courage, the morale bonus on weapon damage rolls increases by 1, but the morale bonus on saves against charm and fear is reduced by 1.
