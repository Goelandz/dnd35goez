This well-made piece of gear, which can be either a riding saddle or a military saddle, is more comfortable and more responsive than a normal saddle. Because of its excellent craftsmanship, a masterwork saddle grants a +1 circumstance bonus on Ride checks. If a masterwork saddle is also a military saddle, this bonus stacks with the +2 circumstance bonus that a military saddle provides to Ride checks relating to staying in the saddle (see Player’s Handbook, page 132).

 Each masterwork saddle is tailored for a specific kind of creature. As such, it fits best on that kind of creature and thus provides its bonus only when used with that kind of creature. For example, a masterwork saddle made for heavy warhorses would provide its bonus if used on any heavy warhorse, but would not provide a bonus if used on a dragon (assuming the saddle was of an appropriate size for the dragon)
