This small crane can be broken down into several parts for easy transportation. It must be assembled and bolted into place to be used effectively. There are different “strengths” available to purchase—the equivalent of a person with Str 22 (lift/drag 1,040 lb.), 24 (lift/drag 1,400 lb.), or 28 (lift/drag 2,400 lb.).
