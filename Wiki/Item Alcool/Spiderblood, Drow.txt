A slight misnomer, this mushroom wine crafted by the drow includes a substantial dose of venom from poisonous spiders. Its taste is remarkable and unlike anything encountered on the surface world. Anyone not used to drinking this wine (usually a nondrow), must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 11) or be poisoned (primary and secondary damage 1d2 Con), in addition to making the Fortitude save against intoxication (DC 11). Those wishing to overcome this poisonous effect must drink one glass over several hours, every day for three months
