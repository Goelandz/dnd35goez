As long as you are able to acquire a new familiar, you may receive a celestial as a familiar.

Prerequisites: Able to acquire a new familiar, minimum level requirement (see below).

Benefit: When choosing a familiar, the following creatures are also available to you. You must choose a familiar whose alignment is the same as yours.

Familiar 		Alignment 	Level
Celestial animal 	Any good 	3rd
Coure eladrin 		Chaotic good 	7th
Lantern archon 		Lawful good 	7th
Musteval guardinal 	eutral good 	7th

The celestial familiar is magically linked to its master like a normal familiar. The familiar uses the basic statistics for a creature of its kind, as given in the Monster Manual or this volume, except as noted below.

Hit Dice: 	For effects related to Hit Dice, use the master’s level or the familiar’s normal total, whichever is higher.
Hit Points: 	One-half the master’s total or the familiar’s normal total, whichever is higher.
Attacks: 	Use the master’s base attack bonus or the familiar’s, whichever is better.
Saving Throws: 	Use the master’s base save bonuses if they are better than the familiar’s.

Familiar Special Abilities: Use the information in the Familiars sidebar on pages 52–53 of the Player’s Handbook to determine additional abilities as you would for a normal familiar. With the exception of celestial animals, celestial familiars do not grant their masters any of the benefits that appear in that sidebar.
