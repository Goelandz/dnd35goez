The character can transform one of her spells into a thing of evil due to a deal she makes with an evil power.

Prerequisite: Any evil alignment. 

Benefit: This feat adds the evil descriptor to a spell. Furthermore, if the spell deals damage, half of the damage is unholy damage. For example, a corrupted fireball cast by a 6th-level wizard deals 6d6 points of damage: 3d6 points of fire damage and 3d6 points of unholy damage.

Thus, creatures immune to fire still potentially take 3d6 points of damage. The corrupted spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level.

Special: A character may take this feat multiple times, choosing a different spell each time.
