You are the holy bane of creatures of a particular type.
Prerequisites: Favored enemy class ability.

Benefit:Choose one of your favored enemies. You can sense the presence of creatures of this type within 60 feet, as well as pinpoint their exact location (distance and direction) relative to you. Normal barriers and obstructions do not block this supernatural ability, allowing you to sense the presence and location of creatures behind doors or walls, for example. This feat does not allow you to see an invisible or hidden creature (although you can still discern its location).

In addition to sensing the presence of your favored enemy, you deal +1d6 points of damage on weapon attack rolls made against evil representatives of the favored enemy creature type.

Special: You can choose this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you select this feat, it applies to a different favored enemy
