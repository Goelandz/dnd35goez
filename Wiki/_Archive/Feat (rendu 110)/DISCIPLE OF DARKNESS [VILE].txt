The character formally supplicates himself to an archdevil.

In return for this obedience, he gains a small measure of power.

Benefit: Once per day, while performing an evil act, the character may call upon his diabolic patron to add a +1 luck bonus on any one die roll.

Special: Once a character takes this feat, he may not take it again; he may not be the disciple of more than one devil.

Nor may he take the Thrall to Demon feat.
