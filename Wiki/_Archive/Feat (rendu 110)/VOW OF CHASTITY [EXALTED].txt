Prerequisites: Sacred Vow.

Benefit: You gain a +4 perfection bonus on Will saving throws against charm and phantasm spells and effects.

Special: To fulfill your vow, you must abstain from any sexual contact with any other creature. If you intentionally break your vow, you immediately and irrevocably lose the benefit of this feat. You may not take another feat to replace it.
