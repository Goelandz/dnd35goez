Instead of an animal companion, you have a magical beast of good alignment.

Prerequisites: Able to acquire a new animal companion, minimum level requirement (see below).

Benefit: When choosing an animal companion, you may choose a magical beast as shown on the table below. You must choose a companion whose alignment is the same as yours, so only a ranger can have a blink dog, pegasus, or unicorn as a companion. Even though your companion is a magical beast, you can cast spells on it as though it were an animal. The exalted companion has all the normal abilities of a typical creature of its kind, as well as the characteristics of an animal companion determined by the druid or ranger’s level.
