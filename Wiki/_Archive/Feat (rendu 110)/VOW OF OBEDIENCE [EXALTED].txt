You have taken a sacred vow to live according to the dictates of another, generally your superior in a religious order or similar organization.
Prerequisites: Sacred Vow.

Benefit: You gain a +4 perfection bonus on Will saving throws against compulsion spells and effects.

Special: To fulfill your vow, you must unquestioningly obey your superior and live according to the rules of your organization. If you intentionally break your vow, you immediately and irrevocably lose the benefit of this feat. You may not take another feat to replace it. If you break your vow as a result of magical compulsion, you lose the benefit of this feat until you perform a suitable penance and receive an atonement spell.
