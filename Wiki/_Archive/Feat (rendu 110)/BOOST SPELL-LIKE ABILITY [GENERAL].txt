One of the creature’s spell-like abilities is harder to resist than it otherwise would be. 

Benefit:The saving throw Difficulty Class (DC) of a boosted spell-like ability is increased by +2. Each of a creature’s spell-like abilities can be boosted three times per day, though the feat does not allow the creature to exceed its normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a succubus chooses to boost its suggestion ability, it can use a boosted suggestion up to three times that day.

Thereafter, it could use its suggestion ability again normally (since it can use suggestion at will), or it could boost another of its spell-like abilities, such as charm monster. 

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to each of its spelllike abilities three additional times per day
