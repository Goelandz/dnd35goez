[Creature Type] Trainer
You are skilled at training a particular type of creature.
Prerequisite: Handle Animal 8 ranks.

Benefit: When you take this feat, choose a type of creature other than animal or beast. You may rear and train creatures of that type, using the Handle Animal skill, as if they were beasts, provided their Intelligence score is 4 or lower.

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new creature type. 

Exceptions: This feat does not increase the DCs for training creatures presented in the Monster Manual, such as the pegasus. However, it lowers them when appropriate.

Normal: Handle Animal does not apply to training creatures other than animals or beasts.
