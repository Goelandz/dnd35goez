You can heal more damage than normal by laying on hands. 
Prerequisites: Cha 13, lay on hands class ability.

Benefit: When determining how many hit points you can cure, treat your Charisma score as if it were 2 points higher. For example, a 7th-level paladin with a 16 Charisma could cure up to 28 points of damage per day with this feat.
