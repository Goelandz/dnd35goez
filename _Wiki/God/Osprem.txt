The goddess of sea travel, Osprem hears a lot of prayer from sailors caught in heavy storms. She is depicted as a beautiful woman riding a barracuda or a whale. Some of her clerics are navigators and doctors aboard galleys, while others tend to the needs of seafaring communities near the coast. Osprem’s priests teach respect for the sea and caution on the water.
