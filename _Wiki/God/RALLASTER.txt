Rallaster, the Razor God, is a deity of murder, torture, and psychotic behavior. Religious scholars refer to him as the Insane God and the God of Madmen, but Rallaster’s followers find him completely sane and comprehensible.

Rallaster is normally pictured as a tall, glistening, ebonyskinned humanoid without hair or wrinkles. Closer inspection reveals that his entire body is made of razors dripping with blood and oil to keep the blades sharp and rust-free. Rallaster’s symbol is a toothy mouth clamped down on a bloody, razor-thin blade.  He is chaotic evil.

Rallaster’s clerics are psychopaths and mass murderers who lurk in the shadows or discreetly in plain sight. Many act perfectly normal, maintaining a second identity as shop clerks or
artisans. Whether they camouflage themselves within society or remain apart from it, Rallaster’s minions delight in torturing and killing their victims, usually in seclusion.

Rallaster has very few temples. His followers are usually loners, and as such they keep secret shrines just for themselves. Each shrine has a small altar made entirely of razo

His favored weapon is the short sword. 
The domains that Rallaster is associated with are Evil, Destruction, and Pain.
