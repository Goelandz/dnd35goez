Pyremius was originally a demigod of assassins and murder, but he slew a goddess of fi re and assumed her portfolio, worshipers and all. He appears as a tiefl ing with ears like a bat’s wings, carrying a fi ery whip and longsword. His followers, mostly assassins and the secretive clerics who give them orders, lash out with fl ame and poison against anything that threatens them. The very notion of a fair fi ght is abhorrent to them; enemies of Pyremius are often murdered in their sleep.
