Alignment: Neutral

As the deity of both victory and fate, Lyris has two aspects. To the bold, she symbolizes the inevitability of victory. Others see her as controlling the great wheel of fate, which promises that each person shall receive his or her just rewards (or punishments) in the afterlife. The clerics of Lyris pray for spells at noon, the “balance point” of the day.
