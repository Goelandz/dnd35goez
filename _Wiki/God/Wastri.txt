Wastri has a strange portfolio (human supremacy and amphibians), so he’s a strange deity: a human with toad features known as the Hopping Prophet. From his jungle fortress-temples, Wastri launches crusades against “lesser races” (anything other than human) and expeditions to protect amphibious life. Many of his followers are cleric/monks who leap into battle, using poisoned weapons to quickly slay their foes.
