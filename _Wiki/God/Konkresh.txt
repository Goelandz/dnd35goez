Alignment: Chaotic Neutral

The deity of brute force, Konkresh is the brother of Halmyr. The two couldn’t be more diametrically opposed in their outlook—where Halmyr is patient, Konkresh is rash; Halmyr rewards skill, while Konkresh believes only in strength. Konkresh is a favorite deity of barbarians and of druids who favor the savage aspect of nature. His clerics pray for spells at dawn.
