Phieran, called the Tortured God, is a deity of suffering, endurance, and perseverance. He is usually depicted as a strong man whose body has been broken and twisted on the rack, leaving him with a limp and covered with scars. 

Phieran gives strength in suffering, eases pain, and exalts martyrs. He is popular among the desperately poor, and he is often called upon by those who must endure torture as well as others in great pain (including women in childbirth). His symbol is a broken chain or a shattered rack.   He is lawful good.

Clerics of Phieran are martyrs in the best possible sense: completely giving, willing to aid virtually anyone in any situation, and happy to take on another’s burdens. They are often found ministering among the poor or in prisons. Phieran’s temples are usually humble shrines found in the poor quarters of large cities.

The domains he is associated with are Endurance, Good, Law, and Protection.

His favored weapon is an unarmed strike.
