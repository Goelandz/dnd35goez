Pholtus, appearing as a slender man in a white robe, represents unyielding law and order, even in the face of the unusual or frightening. He abhors compromise almost as much as he does chaos. He is a rival of St. Cuthbert, whom Pholtus regards as too pragmatic and emotional. Many of Pholtus’s clerics act as judges and arbiters, where they are known for their adherence to the letter of the law.
