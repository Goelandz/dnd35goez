Alignment: Neutral Evil

The deity of death and slaughter, Sulerain is often called the Grim Lady. She is pleased only by destruction and loss of life—the greater the loss, the better. Her worshipers include assassins, evil necromancers, and anyone else attracted by the power of death. Sulerain’s clerics pray for spells at dusk, called “the dying of the sun.”
