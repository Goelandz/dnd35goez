Waiting in the darkness, the Patient One—also known as the Dark Watcher—is a strange and alien creature. Always whispering secrets to itself, the Patient One waits until its time comes, and then it strikes, destroying or consuming everything in its path.

Although never actually pictured in its entirety, this god is known to have many eyes, many mouths, and many clawed arms around its bulbous body. The Patient One’s symbol is a mouth surrounded by eyes, always done in dark colors.  The Patient One is neutral evil.

Though some humanoids worship this strange being, many more aberrations revere it. The Patient One’s temples are towers, often built on high hills in isolated areas. With beholders and mind flayers as clerics and worshipers, the Patient One’s towers are also found underground. At the apex of each tower is a stone altar, carved to appear as a mouth surrounded by eyes, stained dark red with blood.

The domains it is associated with are Evil, Darkness, and Corruption

Its favored weapon is the flail.
