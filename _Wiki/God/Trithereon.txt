Those who venerate Trithereon strive for liberty for themselves and others. His clerics work fervently to end tyrannical regimes or free those in slavery. Followers of Trithereon must often travel in secrecy to avoid harassment from those in positions of power. It is said by some that no ruler ever feels entirely secure when a shrine to Trithereon lies within his borders.
