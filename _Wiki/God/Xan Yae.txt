Xan Yae holds the mastery of the unseen to be the highest ideal; she teaches her followers that anything that achieves true balance disappears into invisible perfection. Accordingly, her clerics and temples are often well-hidden and hard to fi nd. A follower of Xan Yae believes that answers to the greatest mysteries are hidden, so they seek outlongburied ruins, forbidding dungeons, and other places where ancient lore may be found. The Lady of Perfection counts many rogues and monks among her followers, mostly because they appreciate the value of remaining unseen.
