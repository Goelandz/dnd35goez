The serene god Rao is a deity of peace, abhorring violence except against foes incapable of reason (such as many undead). His clerics favor direct action when necessary to restore peace, but would rather engage in discourse than melee. Rao’s church sponsors many libraries, monasteries, and other places of peace, introspection, and learning.
