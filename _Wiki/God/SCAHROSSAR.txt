Known by all as the Mistress of Exquisite Pain, Scahrossar is usually portrayed as a woman covered entirely in tight, studded black leather so that even her face is concealed. She usually holds a whip and a hook. She is selfish, cruel, and domineering, and so are most of her followers. Scahrossar is Olidammara’s sister, but the two deities have nothing to do with each other—only the most obscure religious texts even mention their relationship. Scahrossar is lawful evil.

Scahrossar’s clerics dress as their mistress does, preferring to hide their identities with leather or iron masks. They are all sadists (and most are also masochists) who prefer to give pain rather than actually kill. Sacrificial victims dedicated to Scahrossar often take days to die, for they are tortured to death—the more slowly the better. Scahrossar’s followers delight in the sounds of screams and tearing flesh, and because they try to prolong a victim’s agony, many are skilled in the healing arts. In their spare time, the clerics devise new tortures and new torture devices.

Temples to the Mistress of Exquisite Pain are hidden behind false facades. The clerics often maintain front businesses, such as bakeries, dairies, and curiosity shops, with the temples accessible through hidden doors. The temple’s rooms are soundproofed to muffle the cries of pain. Although most of Scahrossar’s clerics are compulsive about keeping their temples clean, it is usually impossible to keep a dribble of blood or a loose tooth from dropping to the floor at any given time. Altars are usually baroque monstrosities of spikes, spines, clamps, and chains

He is associated with the domains of Evil, Pain, and Death. 

Her favored weapon is the whip.
