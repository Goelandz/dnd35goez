Once a human martial artist, Zuoken attained such mental and physical perfection that Xan Yae raised him into godhood several centuries ago. His clerics watch over creatures with psionics or other mental powers, safeguarding them from harm. Zuoken encourages his followers to be disciplined, serene masters of their minds and bodies. 

His symbol is a striking fi st, and his favored weapon is the nunchaku.
