Not a single god, but an entity composed of at least six separate beings, the Xammux represents cold, analytical thinking taken to its extreme. The Xammux serves as the patron of utter indifference and of delving into forbidden knowledge through exploration and experimentation.

The symbol of the Xammux is a pair of glistening, razorsharp steel calipers. The Xammux is neutral evil. 

Clerics of the Xammux are cold, uncaring beings who are fascinated by knowledge. They think nothing of dissecting living creatures simply to learn more about their biology. They place creatures in torture chambers to see how long they can withstand terrible pain before their psyches crumble.

The temples of the Xammux are stark stone edifices filled with traps and ingenious locks. White plaster often covers the interior walls. Altars dedicated to the Xammux are always made of polished steel.

It is associated with the Evil, Knowledge, and Darkness domains. 
Its favored weapon is the short sword (which Xammux’s clerics call a long knife).
