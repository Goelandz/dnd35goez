Cyndor, depicted as a rough-hewn humanoid statue, has three duties: meditating on the nature of space and time, recording the actions of every creature in his Perpetual Libram, and guarding time itself from those who would steal or twist it. His clerics espouse a philosophy based cause and effect. Actions have consequences that can’t be avoided, only delayed.
