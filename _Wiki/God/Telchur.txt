Telchur, the god of winter and cold, is usually depicted as a gaunt man with dark eyes and beard made of icicles. His clerics rarely leave the arctic regions, where they help communities there survive the bleak, frigid conditions. 

Telchur’s attitude is that cold separates the weak from the strong, checks unbridled passions and overabundant life. Whenever cold wind blows out the fi re of hope, whenever snow covers the farmer’s fi eld in white silence, Telchur is there.
