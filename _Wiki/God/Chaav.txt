Olidammara is often known as the Laughing Rogue, but Chaav is the Smiling God, whose laughter comes from pure and simple delight in the world and its inhabitants. The god of joy is normally pictured as a boy or very young man with a wide smile and easy manner. He is usually found in the company of his sister, Lastai. Chaav teaches a dogma of enjoyment, pleasure, and delight. He cares little for elaborate humor or wordplay, and has no tolerance for those who laugh at others’ expense. He is often revered by sprites, good satyrs, and other good fey that share his delight in simple pleasures. Chaav’s symbol is a bunch of wildflowers.

Chaav’s clerics work with simple farmers and artisans, and only rarely join adventuring bands. They labor to bring joy to all people they encounter, not just the laughter from a funny joke, but the joy, peace, and contentment with life that a pure heart can bring. Chaav has some small shrines in small hamlets and villages, but they are modest affairs even by the standards of such small communities.

The domains he is associated with are Chaos, Good, Joy, and Trickery. He is chaotic good.

His favored weapon is the quarterstaff.
