Brought upon by long-term, intense fury and hatred, this disease manifests as dark boils across the skin. The incubation period—in this case, the amount of time during which a character must be angry—varies, but it usually takes at least a year for festering anger to erupt. Each day after the onset of this malady, the character takes 1d3 points of Constitution damage, but she gains a cumulative +2 enhancement bonus to Strength.

Each day, the victim must succeed at an additional Will saving throw (DC 22) or attack whatever has made him so angry. The victim is obsessed with taking action against the focus of his anger, but isn’t completely heedless of danger. If the focus of the victim’s anger isn’t readily available, the victim will instead attack allies, minions, or symbols that remind him of the reason for his hate. For example, a farmer suffering from festering anger directed at the king won’t necessarily march toward the palace after failing a Will save. He might instead attack the royal guards in the marketplace, pick a fight with the local tax collector, or vandalize the king’s statue in the city square.
