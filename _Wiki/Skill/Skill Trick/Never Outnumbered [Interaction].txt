You can demoralize multiple enemies.

Prerequisite: Intimidate 8 ranks.

Benefit: When you use Intimidate to demoralize an opponent (PH 76), you can affect all enemies within 10 feet that 
can see you, rather than only a single enemy you threaten.

Each enemy rolls a separate modified level check to oppose your Intimidate check, but the skill check otherwise works as normal.
