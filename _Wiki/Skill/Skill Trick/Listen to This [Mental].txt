You can perfectly repeat to others what you hear.

Prerequisite: Listen 5 ranks.

Benefit: Whenever you make a successful Listen check to hear a noise, you can describe that sound any time up to 1 hour later with such clarity that any individuals hearing the description are treated as if they had heard the sound themselves.

This trick is particularly useful if you overhear a conversation but don’t understand the language spoken, since it 
allows you to repeat it verbatim to an ally who might be able to translate.
