You can perfectly imitate a small habit or idiosyncrasy of a person you impersonate in order to throw off suspicion.

Prerequisite: Disguise 5 ranks.

Benefit: When impersonating a particular individual, you can eliminate the normal Spot bonus granted to a viewer familiar with that individual (PH 73). The effect extends to all viewers.

Using this trick requires no special action, but you can maintain the deception for only 1 hour per day
