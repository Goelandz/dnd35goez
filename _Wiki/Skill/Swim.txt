SWIM (STR; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)
Using this skill, a land-based creature can swim, dive, navigate underwater obstacles, and so on. 

Check: Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to one-half your speed (as 
a full-round action) or at one-quarter your speed (as a move action). 

If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress through the water. 

If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater. If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his or her breath only half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round to continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the Constitution check, you begin to drown (see Suffocation and Drowning in the Dungeon Master’s Guide). 

The DC for the Swim check depends on the water, as given on the table below. 
Water 		Swim DC 
Calm water 	10 
Rough water 	15 
Stormy water 	20

Diving: Characters who dive into water take no damage on a successful DC 15 Swim check or DC 15 Tumble check, so long as the water is at least 10 feet deep for every 30 feet fallen. Water 30 feet deep is sufficient for a dive from any height. However, the DC of the check increases by 5 for every 50 feet of the dive. The table below summarizes these rules

Dive 	Min. 	Safe 	Damage for
Height 	Depth 	DC 	Failed Dive
10 ft. 	10 ft. 	15 	None
20 ft. 	10 ft. 	15 	None
30 ft. 	10 ft.	15 	1d3 nonlethal
40 ft. 	20 ft. 	15 	2d3 nonlethal
50 ft. 	20 ft. 	20 	2d3 nonlethal + 1d6
60 ft. 	20 ft. 	20 	2d3 nonlethal + 2d6
70 ft. 	30 ft. 	20 	2d3 nonlethal + 3d6
80 ft. 	30 ft. 	20 	2d3 nonlethal + 4d6
90 ft. 	30 ft. 	20 	2d3 nonlethal + 5d6
100 ft. 30 ft. 	20 	2d3 nonlethal + 6d6
110 ft. 30 ft. 	25 	2d3 nonlethal + 7d6
120 ft. 30 ft. 	25 	2d3 nonlethal + 8d6
160 ft. 30 ft. 	30 	2d3 nonlethal + 12d6
210 ft. 30 ft. 	35 	2d3 nonlethal + 17d6
240 ft. 30 ft. 	35 	2d3 nonlethal + 20d61

Each hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from fatigue. 

Action: A successful Swim check allows you to swim one-quarter of your speed as a move action or one-half your speed as a full-round action. 

Special: Swim checks are subject to double the normal armor check penalty and encumbrance penalty (see pages 123 and 162). For instance, full plate incurs a –12 penalty on Swim checks instead of –6. 

=====Expanded Skill=====

You can swim more quickly than normal.

Accelerated Swimming: You try to swim more quickly than normal. By accepting a –10 penalty on your Swim check, you can swim at up to your speed as a full-round action (rather than half your speed or at half your speed as a move action (rather than onequarter).
