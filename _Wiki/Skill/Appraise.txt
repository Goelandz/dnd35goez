APPRAISE (INT)
Use this skill to tell an antique from old junk, a sword that’s old and fancy from an elven heirloom, and high-quality jewelry from cheap stuff made to look good. 

Check: You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50% to 150%. The DM secretly rolls a 2d6+3, multiplies the result by 10%, multiplies the actual value by that percentage, then tells you the resulting value for the item. (For a common or well-known item, your chance of estimating the value within 10% is fairly high even if you fail the check—in such a case, you made a lucky guess.) 

Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the item’s value. 

A magnifying glass (page 130) gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed, such as a gem. A merchant’s scale (page 130) gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any items that are valued by weight, including anything made of precious metals. These bonuses stack. 

Action: Appraising an item takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round actions). 

Try Again: No. You cannot try again on the same object, regardless of success. 

=====Expanded Skill=====

Whether performing a daring burglary or a hasty act of espionage, adventurers don’t always have time to carefully study the value of potential loot. Characters can use the Appraise skill to make a quick but rough estimation of an item’s value.

Check: You can appraise an item quickly, but the DC is higher. Failing the check means that you cannot estimate the item’s value.

Item (Examples) DC
Common 15
 Trade goods (spices, food stuffs, raw  materials, etc.), mundane items, livestock 

Rare 20
 Fine clothing, precious metals (unworked), gems, artwork

Exotic 25
 Unusual gems (strange colorings, unusual  to the region, unusually large or pure), spell  components, jewelry, obscure religious items

Unique 30+
 Masterpiece artwork, royal jewels, crowns,  or other adornments

Action: Appraising an item quickly takes 1 round.

Try Again: You can try to appraise an item normally (requires 1 minute), but you cannot try to appraise the item quickly again. You can try to appraise an item normally whether or not you successfully appraise the item  quickly.

Special: The Appraise Magic Value feat enables you to use the Appraise skill to determine a magic item’s  properties; see the feat description on page 103.
