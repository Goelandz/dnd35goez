The animal aids your defense or that of another creature as a standard action. You must designate both the recipient of the aid and a specific opponent when commanding the animal to perform the task. The animal uses the aid another combat action, attempting to grant a bonus on the recipient’s AC against the designated opponent’s next attack. An animal must know the defend trick (Player’s Handbook, page 75) before it can learn this trick.
