The animal aids your attack or that of another creature as a standard action. You must designate both the recipient of the aid and a specific opponent when commanding the animal to perform the task. The animal uses the aid another combat action (see page 154 of the Player’s Handbook), attempting to grant a bonus on the recipient’s next attack roll against the designated opponent. It also flanks the designated opponent, if it can do so without provoking attacks of opportunity. An animal must know the attack trick (Player’s Handbook, page 74) before it can learn this trick.
