DISABLE DEVICE (INT; TRAINED ONLY)
Use this skill to disarm a trap, jam a lock (in either the open or closed position), or rig a wagon wheel to fall off. You can examine a fairly simple or fairly small mechanical device and disable it. The 
effort requires at least a simple tool of the appropriate sort (a pick, pry bar, saw, file, etc.). Attempting a Disable Device check without a set of thieves’ tools (page 130) carries a –2 circumstance penalty, even if a simple tool is employed. The use of masterwork thieves’ tools enables you to make the check with a +2 circumstance bonus. 

Check: Your DM makes the Disable Device check for you secretly, so that you don’t necessarily know whether you’ve succeeded. The DC depends on how tricky the device is. Disabling (or rigging or jamming) a fairly simple device has a DC of 10; more intricate and complex devices have higher DCs. 

If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you spring it. If you’re attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally. 

You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally for a while and then fail or fall off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use). 

Device 		Time 		Disable Device DC 	Example 
Simple 		1 round 	10 			Jam a lock 
Tricky 		1d4 rounds 	15 			Sabotage a wagon wheel 
Difficult 	2d4 rounds 	20 			Disarm a trap, reset a trap 
Wicked 		2d4 rounds 	25 			Disarm a complex trap,  cleverly sabotage a  clockwork device 

Action: The amount of time needed to make a Disable Device check depends on the task, as noted above. Disabling a simple device takes 1 round and is a full-round action. An intricate or complex device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds. 

Try Again: Varies. You can retry if you have missed the check by 4 or less, though you must be aware that you have failed in order to try again. 

=====Expanded Skill=====

You can reduce the amount of time it takes to disable a device or add a bypass element to an existing trap.

Bypass Trap: You try to incorporate a bypass element enabling you to avoid a trap’s effects if you encounter it again later. Doing this imposes a –10 penalty on your Disable Device check. If you succeed, you can not only bypass a trap without disarming it (just as if you had beat the trap’s DC by 10 or more—see page 72 of the Player’s Handbook) but also add a bypass element allowing you or your companions to avoid triggering the trap again later. For example, you could insert a wedge that blocks the gears of a mechanical trap, or pick out a narrow path between the pressure plates that trigger poison darts from the wall.

Quick Disable: You can try to disable a device more quickly than normal. To reduce the time required to disable any device to a full-round action, add +20 to the DC. For example, a trap that normally requires a DC 20 check and 2d4 rounds to disarm could be disabled in 1 round with a successful DC 40 check.
