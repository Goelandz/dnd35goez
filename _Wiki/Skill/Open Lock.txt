OPEN LOCK (DEX; TRAINED ONLY)
You can pick padlocks, finesse combination locks, and solve puzzle locks. The effort requires at least a simple tool of the appropriate sort (a pick, pry bar, blank key, wire, or the like). Attempting an Open Lock check without a set of thieves’ tools (page 130) imposes a –2 circumstance penalty on the check, even if a simple tool is employed. If you use masterwork thieves’ tools, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check. 

Check: The DC for opening a lock varies from 20 to 40, depending on the quality of the lock, as given on the table below. 

Lock DC Lock 		DC 
Very simple lock 	20  
Average lock 		25 
Good lock 		30
Amazing lock 		40

Action: Opening a lock is a full-round action. 

=====Expanded Skill=====

You can rush an Open Lock attempt, reducing the amount of time it takes to perform the attempt.

Quick Lockpick: You can try to open a lock more quickly than normal. To reduce the time required to open any lock to a move action, add 20 to the DC. For example, opening an average lock normally requires a DC 25 check and requires a full-round action. To open the lock as a move action requires a DC 45 check.
