SENSE MOTIVE (WIS)
Use this skill to tell when someone is bluffing you, to discern hidden messages in conversations, or to sense when someone is being magically influenced. This skill represents sensitivity to the body language, speech habits, and mannerisms of others. 

Check: A successful check lets you avoid being bluffed (see the Bluff skill, page 67). You can also use this skill to determine when “something is up” (that is, something odd is going on) or to assess someone’s trustworthiness. Your DM may decide to make your Sense Motive check secretly, so that you don’t necessarily know whether you were successful. 

Task Sense Motive 		DC 
Hunch 				20 
Sense enchantment 		25 or 15 
Discern secret message 		Varies

Hunch: This use of the skill involves making a gut assessment of the social situation. You can get the feeling from another’s behavior that something is wrong, such as when you’re talking to an impostor. Alternatively, you can get the feeling that someone is trustworthy. 

Sense Enchantment: You can tell that someone’s behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (by definition, a mind-affecting effect), such as charm person, even if that person isn’t aware of it. The usual DC is 25, but if the target is dominated (see dominate person in Chapter 11: Spells), the DC is only 15 because of the limited range of the target’s activities. 

Discern Secret Message: You may use Sense Motive to detect that a hidden message is being transmitted via the Bluff skill. In this case, your Sense Motive check is opposed by the Bluff check of the character transmitting the message. For each piece of information relating to the message that you are missing, you take a –2 penalty on your Sense Motive check. For example, if you eavesdrop on people planning to assassinate a visiting diplomat, you take a –2 penalty on your check if you don’t know about the diplomat. If you succeed by 4 or less, you know that something hidden is being communicated, but you can’t learn anything specific about its content. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you intercept and understand the message. If you fail by 4 or less, you don’t detect any hidden communication. If you fail by 5 or more, you infer some false information. 

Combat prediction: You get a good though general idea of an opponent's combat skill. This use of the skill requires you to spend a mini-mum of 3 rounds observing an opponent who is engaged in combat. You can take no other actions in that time other than moving your normal movement rate. You must keep your subject in view at all times. The DC is 20 +1 for every experience level your opponent has attained. If successful, you gain a +4 bonus on your first attack roll against the observed opponent. This attack must come within 24 hours of the observation or the bonus is lost. You cannot gain this bonus against the same opponent twice unless the character's level has changed since you last observed him.

Decipher strategy: You assess a combat situation and determine its true purpose. You must observe the combat for a minimum of 3 rounds before making the skill check. The DC is 15 +1 for every opponent's true motive (cut you to pieces, lure you away from or drive you toward a particular spot, rescue a captive, and so on)

Action: Trying to gain information with Sense Motive generally takes at least 1 minute, and you could spend a whole evening trying to get a sense of the people around you. 

Try Again: No, though you may make a Sense Motive check for each Bluff check made against you. 

=====Expanded Skill=====

You can assess the combat prowess of an opponent, identifying particularly dangerous or vulnerable foes.
 
Assess Opponent: As a standard action, you can use Sense Motive to ascertain how tough a challenge an opponent poses for you, based on your level and your opponent’s CR. This skill check is opposed by the opponent’s Bluff check. To attempt this task, your opponent must be visible to you and within 30 feet. If you have seen the opponent in combat, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.

 The accuracy of the assessment depends on the amount by which your Sense Motive check result exceeds the opposed Bluff check result. On a successful Sense Motive opposed check, you can gain the following information:

					Assess Opponent
Opponent’s CR 				Result
-----------------------------------------------------------
4 or more less than your level/HD 	A pushover
1, 2, or 3 less than your level/HD 	Easy
Equal to your level/HD 			A fair fight
Equal to your level/HD plus 1, 2, or 3 	A tough challenge
Exceeds your level/HD by 4 or more 	A dire threat

A successful assessment reveals that your foe belongs in one of two adjacent categories (for example, “Easy” or “A fair fight”). If your Sense Motive check result exceeds the opposed Bluff check result by 10 or more, you can narrow the result down to a single category.

 By contrast, if the target’s Bluff check result equals or slightly exceeds your Sense Motive check result, you gain no useful information. If the target’s Bluff check result exceeds your Sense Motive check result by 5 or more, you may (at the DM’s option) gain a false impression, believing your opponent to be much stronger or weaker than he really is (equal chance of either). If the target’s Bluff check result exceeds your Sense Motive check result by 10 or more, your assessment is off by at least two categories (for example, a dire threat might be assessed as a fair fight).

Special: The Combat Intuition feat (see page 106) grants a +4 bonus on Sense Motive checks made to assess opponents. It also enables you to narrow your assessment of your opponent’s combat capabilities to a single category. Finally, it allows you to accomplish this task as a free action.

 An opponent that is particularly vulnerable to your typical attack routine (for example, a vampire facing a high-level cleric of Pelor) registers as one category less challenging; one who is resistant to your typical attack routine (for example, a golem opposing a rogue who relies heavily on sneak attacks) registers as one category more challenging.

Try Again: You can use this skill on a different opponent each round
