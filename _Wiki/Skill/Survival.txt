SURVIVAL (WIS)
Use this skill to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide a party safely through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards. 

Check: You can keep yourself and others safe and fed in the wild. The table below gives the DCs for various tasks that require Survival checks.

Survival does not allow you to follow difficult tracks unless you are a ranger or have the Track feat (see the Restriction section below). 

DC 	Task 
10 	Get along in the wild. Move up to one-half your overland speed while hunting and foraging (no food or water supplies needed). You can provide food and water for one other person for every 2 points by which your check result exceeds 10. 
15 	Gain a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saves against severe weather while moving up to one-half your overland speed, or gain a +4 bonus if you remain stationary. You may grant the same bonus to one other character for every 1 point by which your Survival check result exceeds 15. 
15 	Keep from getting lost or avoid natural hazards, such as quicksand. 
15 	Predict the weather up to 24 hours in advance. For every 5 points by which your Survival check result exceeds 15, you can predict the weather for one additional day in advance. 
Varies 	Follow tracks (see the Track feat).

Action: Varies. A single Survival check may represent activity over the course of hours or a full day. A Survival check made to find tracks is at least a full-round action, and it may take even longer at the DM’s discretion. 

Try Again: Varies. For getting along in the wild or for gaining the Fortitude save bonus noted in the table above, you make a Survival check once every 24 hours. The result of that check applies until the next check is made. To avoid getting lost or avoid natural hazards, you make a Survival check whenever the situation calls for one. Retries to avoid getting lost in a specific situation or to avoid a specific natural hazard are not allowed. For finding tracks, you can 
retry a failed check after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes(indoors) of searching. 

Restriction: While anyone can use Survival to find tracks (regardless of the DC), or to follow tracks when the DC for the task is 10 or lower, only a ranger (or a character with the Track feat; see page 101) can use Survival to follow tracks when the task has a higher DC. 

=====Expanded Skill=====

You can blaze a trail through the wilderness, improving your and your allies’ overland speed.

Trailblazing: When traveling in poor conditions or difficult terrain, you can attempt a Survival check to hasten your group’s progress.

 On a check result of 15 or better, you increase the movement modifier for overland movement by 1/4, to a maximum of ×1 (see Table 9–5: Terrain and Overland Movement, page 164 of the Player’s Handbook). For example, you could increase your movement rate through trackless jungle from ×1/4 to ×1/2 your normal overland movement rate. With a result of 25 or higher, you can increase the movement modifier by 1/2 (and thus could travel through trackless jungle at ×3/4 your normal rate). In either case the ×1 maximum still applies—that is, you can improve up to but not exceed your normal movement rate by this means.

 You can guide a group of up to four individuals (including yourself) at no penalty. However, for each three additional people (rounded up) in the group being guided, apply a –2 penalty to the trailblazing attempt. Thus, a group of five to seven (yourself and four to six others) would incur a –2 penalty, a group of eight to ten a –4 penalty, and so forth.

 This ability applies only to long-distance overland movement—it has no effect on tactical movement.
