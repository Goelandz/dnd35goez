BALANCE (DEX; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)
You can keep your balance while walking on a tightrope, a narrow beam, a slippery ledge, or an uneven floor. 

Check: You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you move at half your speed along the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means you can’t move for 1 round. A failure by 5 or more means you fall. The difficulty varies with the surface, as follows: 

Narrow 	Surface 		Balance	DC	Difficult Surface 	Balance DC
7–12 inches wide 		10 		Uneven flagstone 	10
2–6 inches wide 		15 		Hewn stone floor 	10
Less than 2 inches wide 	20 		Sloped or angled floor 	10

Narrow Surface Modifiers 
Surface 							DC Modifier
Lightly obstructed (scree, light rubble) 			+2 
Severely obstructed (natural cavern floor, dense rubble) 	+5 
Lightly slippery (wet floor) 					+2 
Severely slippery (ice sheet) 					+5 
Sloped or angled 						+2 

Being Attacked while Balancing: You are considered flat-footed while balancing, since you can’t move to avoid a blow, and thus you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). If you have 5 or more ranks in Balance, you aren’t considered flat-footed while balancing. If you take damage while balancing, you must make another Balance check against the same DC to remain standing. 

Accelerated Movement: You can try to walk across a precarious surface more quickly than normal. If you accept a –5 penalty, you can move your full speed as a move action. (Moving twice your speed in a round requires two Balance checks, one for each move action used.) You may also accept this penalty in order to charge across a precarious surface; charging requires one Balance check for each multiple of your speed (or fraction thereof ) that you charge. 

Green Water: A ship’s deck that is washed by a violent wave that covers the deck to a depth of 1 foot or more.

Heeling Deck: A ship that is heeling over (the deck is sloped sharply due to the way it’s running with the wind or the ship’s maneuvers) is the same as a sloped floor.

Roll, Heavy: A ship that is violently rolling from side to side, as opposed to simply heeling in one direction and staying there.

Sargasso: Floating mats of seaweed come in two varieties: light and heavy. Only those who are truly light of foot can remain standing on light mat sargasso, but heavy mat sargasso is thick enough to support anyone walking with a little care.

Surf: Moving water between 1 foot (light surf) and 4 feet deep (heavy surf).

Yardarm: The horizontal spar suspended from a ship’s mast. Deckhands taking in or setting sails generally stand on sturdy lines below the yardarm and lean into the yardarm for support; walking on top of a yardarm is a real stunt, since there isn’t anything to brace against.

Action: None. A Balance check doesn’t require an action; it is made as part of another action or as a reaction to a situation. 

=====Expanded Skill=====

You can run across narrow surfaces or resist being tripped.

 Resist Trip: If you have 10 or more ranks in Balance, you can make a Balance check in place of a Strength or Dexterity check to avoid being tripped by an opponent. You take a –10 penalty on your Balance check. If you succeed on this check, you are not tripped. When you succeed on a Balance check to resist being tripped, you may not attempt to trip your opponent.

Sprinting Balance: You can try to run across a narrow surface by accepting a –20 penalty on your Balance check.
