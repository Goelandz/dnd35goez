LISTEN (WIS)
Use this skill to hear approaching enemies, to detect someone sneaking up on you from behind, or to eavesdrop on someone else’s conversation. 

Check: Your Listen check is either made against a DC that reflects how quiet the noise is that you might hear, or it is opposed by your target’s Move Silently check. Your DM may decide to make the Listen check for you, so that you don’t know whether not hearing anything means that nothing is there, or that you failed the check. 

Listen DC 	Sound

 15 		A 1st-level rogue using Move Silently to sneak past the listener 
 15 		People whispering1
 19 		A cat stalking 
 30 		An owl gliding in for a kill

In the case of people trying to be quiet, the DCs given on the table could be replaced by Move Silently checks, in which case the indicated DC would be their average check result (or close to it). For instance, the DC 19 noted on the table for a cat stalking means that an average cat has a +9 bonus on Move Silently checks. Assuming an average roll of 10 on 1d20, its Move Silently check result would be 19. 

Background Noise: Adventurers in or around water often have to contend with significant background noise—the sound of the surf, the slap of water on a boat’s hull, the rush and break of wavelets even in calm waters, or the rushing of a river or stream. If either the listener or the origin of a sound is in an area of background noise, the DC of any Listen checks increases as shown below. Sounds that pass over or through such conditions are also affected.

Action: Varies. Every time you have a chance to hear something in a reactive manner (such as when someone makes a noise or you move into a new area), you can make a Listen check without using an action. Trying to hear something you failed to hear previously is a move action. 

Try Again: Yes. You can try to hear something that you failed to hear previously with no penalty.
