This tiny brittle object is often disguised as a button or other decoration. You can throw a flash pellet as a ranged attack with a range increment of 5 feet. When thrown against a hard surface, it bursts with a bright flash of light. All creatures within a 5-foot-radius burst must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round and dazzled for 1 round after that.
