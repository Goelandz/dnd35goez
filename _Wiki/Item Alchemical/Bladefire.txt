Similar to alchemist’s fire but less volatile, this thick, adhesive liquid ignites when exposed to air. Bladefire is typically poured along the length of a bladed weapon, causing the weapon to burn for a short period of time. A weapon treated with bladefire burns for 1d6 rounds. While burning, the weapon sheds light as a torch. A weapon treated with bladefire deals 1 additional point of fire damage with each successful hit. Applying bladefire to a weapon is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Bladefire is thick enough that once applied, it does not flow down the weapon, preventing it from harming the user. Each round that bladefire burns, it also deals 1 point of fire damage to the weapon that it coats, but most weapons have sufficient hardness to ignore this damage. Wooden weapons coated with bladefire ignite, however, taking 1d6 points of fire damage each round until extinguished. Setting flammable items alight requires more contact than just an attack. To light a flammable item requires a full-round action if the item is unattended or a successful grapple check against the opponent wearing or using the item. If your opponent breaks the grapple before your next action, no items catch fire. If you don’t release the grapple on your next action, any flammable item you wear or carry also catches fire.
