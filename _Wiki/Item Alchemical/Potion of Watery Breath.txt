This aquamarine potion is the opposite of the fire breath potion. It grants the drinker the ability to launch massive amounts of water from her mouth, similar to the geyser effect of the decanter of endless water. She can breathe water up to three times, creating a 20-foot-long, 1-foot-wide stream of water at 30 gallons per round. The force of this geyser deals 1d4 points of damage against one target, who must make a Strength check (DC 12) to avoid being knocked down. The water also douses most normal fires but has no effect against magical flames. Unused blasts dissipate 1 hour after the potion is consumed. The potion does not allow the drinker to breathe underwater.
