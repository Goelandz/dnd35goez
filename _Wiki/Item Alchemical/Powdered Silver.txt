This fine silvery dust sparkles when held in the light and is contained in a half-inch-diameter glass sphere. A powdered silver pellet can be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 5 feet.

Alternatively, it can be loaded into a sling and used as a sling bullet. When it strikes a firm surface, the pellet bursts and sprays out the powder within. Any creature with damage reduction that is overcome by silvered weapons takes 1d6 points of damage and is sickened for 1 round if hit by a powdered silver pellet (a DC 12 Fortitude save negates the sickened condition, but not the damage). Other creatures take no damage from a powdered silver pellet.
