A quickfrost alchemical capsule coats a melee weapon or a thrown weapon with a thin sheet of oil that instantly cools to a dangerously low temperature. This substance allows the weapon to deal extra cold damage for a short amount of time without damaging the weapon or its wielder. A weapon treated with quickfrost deals 1d6 points of cold damage with each successful strike. The capsule’s effects last for 1 round, ending at the beginning of the wielder’s next turn. This cold damage doesn’t stack with any other cold damage the weapon deals.
