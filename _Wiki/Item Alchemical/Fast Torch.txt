This item consists of a tube of waxed paper set into a short wooden handle. The end opposite the handle has a wax seal, and the whole item is about the size of a normal torch. An alchemical substance packed inside the tube ignites when exposed to air. Lighting the torch is as simple as removing the wax seal, which requires a swift action.

The lit torch produces a brilliant white light that produces bright illumination in a 30-foot radius and shadowy illumination 30 feet beyond that.

A fast torch burns for 10 minutes, even in high winds or underwater (though it can't be ignited underwater). It's possible to extinguish a fast torch by burying it in sand (or a similar substance) or by grinding it out against a nonflammable surface. Either method requires a full-round action; once extinguished, it can't be relit.
