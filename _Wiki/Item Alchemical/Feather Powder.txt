Originally designed as a weapon against devas and lammasus, this dark red alchemical powder comes in a small glass vial thrown as a grenadelike weapon. Anyone struck or splashed by the powder must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 15) or take a –1 circumstance penalty on attack and damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 minute due to irritation and itching. Creatures with feathers are particularly susceptible, taking a –2 circumstance penalty on the Fortitude save against feather powder and suffering double the effect (–2 penalty) if they fail the save.
