This strong vapor clears away fog, mist, and clouds in seconds, allowing you to see more clearly.

Description: Bottled air is stored as blue-tinted liquid in glass vials. It gives off a strong acrid smell. When a vial is opened, the liquid turns to mist and expands outward, creating a small area of fresh, clean air.

Activation: To activate bottled air, the vial in which it is stored must be opened (a standard action). Bottled air can also be thrown as a splash weapon; the vial breaks on contact and releases the mist into the air.

Effect: Bottled air clears fog, smoke, and other gases from the square it occupies. If you are carrying a vial when it is opened, you can apply the effect to a single square adjacent to you. That square, and only that square, will be cleared. A creature that stands in a clear square still gains the benefi t of concealment from obscured squares around it, but it loses those benefits against foes adjacent to the clear space.

 Once released from its vial, bottled air lasts for 2d4 rounds before it sputters out.
