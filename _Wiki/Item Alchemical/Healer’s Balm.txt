This smooth, sweet-smelling balm allows a healer to better soothe the effects of wounds, disease, and poison. Healer’s balm provides a +1 alchemical bonus on Heal checks made to help an affected creature. The effects of healer’s balm last for 1 minute.

 One dose of healer’s balm is enough to coat one Medium creature. Applying healer’s balm is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. It can be applied as part of a standard action made to administer first aid, treat a wound, or treat poison.
