This alchemical powder creates a loud crackling noise, like a broomstick breaking, whenever it is jostled or struck. A single packet covers a 5-foot-radius area; applying the powder requires a full-round action. Once in place, the powder remains active for 1 hour and imposes a –10 penalty on Move Silently checks made when traversing the area.
