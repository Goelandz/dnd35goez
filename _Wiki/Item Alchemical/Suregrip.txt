This thick white paste, when applied to hands and feet, strengthens and steadies the user’s grip, making it easier for the character to climb. Suregrip provides a +1 alchemical bonus on Climb checks for 1 minute. 

 One dose of suregrip is enough to cover the hands and feet of one Medium creature. Applying suregrip is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
