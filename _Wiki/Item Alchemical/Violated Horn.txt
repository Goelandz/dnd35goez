Also a quasi-magical item, the violated horn is a unicorn’s horn that has been removed from a stillliving unicorn, leaving the creature crippled and in constant, terrible pain. For a violated horn to have special power, it must physically violate a victim during a perverse religious ritual conducted atop an altar dedicated to an evil god. The character performing the ritual must succeed at a Knowledge (arcana) check (DC 20) to perform the ritual properly, and no second tries are possible with that particular horn if the first check fails. Once a violated horn is powered, its possessor can break the horn at any time thereafter and be immediately transported to the site of the ritual as if a word of recall spell had been cast.
