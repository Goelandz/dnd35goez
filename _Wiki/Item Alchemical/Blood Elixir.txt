A blood elixir is a concoction brewed from the concentrated blood of a true dragon. A blood elixir grants the drinker a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength (if brewed from a chromatic dragon) or Charisma (if brewed from a metallic dragon), as well as an additional effect as noted on the table below, based on the dragon’s variety. You can consume a blood elixir as a full-round action (which provokes attacks of opportunity), and its effects last for 10 minutes.

These effects are extraordinary, not magical.
