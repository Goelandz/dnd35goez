This small ceramic sphere is packed with alchemical explosives, rotting meat, and offal infected with filth fever. When thrown as a grenadelike weapon, it spreads disease in its wake. The explosion on impact is not enough to cause physical harm, but it does spray the rotten contents and infection in a 20-foot burst. All within the burst must make saving throws as if exposed to filth fever (Fort DC 12; see the Disease section in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide). Unlike normal exposure to filth fever, the victim need not be injured
