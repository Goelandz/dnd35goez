This container is made from thick leather with a cap sewn on tight and fitted with a ripcord. Pulling the cord rips open the flask and activates the alchemical substance within. The flask emits a high-pitched shriek in a 15-foot cone. Anything in the cone takes 1d8 points of sonic damage and is deafened for 1 minute (Fortitude DC 15 negates).
