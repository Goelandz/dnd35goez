Lockslip grease is a thick reddish oil that loosens the mechanical workings of nonmagicallocks. The grease is effective for a short time and provides a slight edge to those attempting to pick a lock. Lockslip grease provides a +1 alchemical bonus on Open Lock checks made against the affected lock for 1 minute.

 One dose of lockslip grease is enough to affect the mechanism of a lock of any size. Although lockslip grease can affect any kind of mundane mechanical lock, it has no effect on magic locks. Applying lockslip grease to a lock is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
