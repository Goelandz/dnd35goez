This dry white powder sharpens a creature’s hearing when applied to the ear. The powder is effective for only a short time, so it is more often used by those trying to avoid guards or sentries than by those tasked with guarding an area for a longer time. Keenear powder provides a +1 alchemical bonus on Listen checks for 1 minute.

 One dose of keenear powder is enough to affect the hearing of a creature of any size, but the creature must have ears to gain any benefit from the powder. Applying keenear powder is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity
