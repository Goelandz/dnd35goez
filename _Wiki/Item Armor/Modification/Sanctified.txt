While most clerics adorn their equipment with images associated with their faith, sanctified armor is actually engraved with the holy or unholy symbol of a religion. This modifi cation makes the armor a legitimate divine focus for divine spellcasters of that faith. Normally, a divine focus does not have to be in hand to cast a spell, so a sanctified shield is a matter of personal style for clerics who prefer a shield to an amulet. Of course, a sanctifi ed shield can be useful as a backup in case your primary focus is lost or damaged.
