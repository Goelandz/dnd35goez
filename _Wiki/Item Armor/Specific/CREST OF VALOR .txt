Designed to fit atop any helm, this crest is actually a small golden statuette of a griffon. Behind it trails a long, blood-red plume that could well be visible even across afield of battle. 

While wearing a crest of valor, you gain a +2 morale bonus on melee weapon damage rolls while your current hit point total is equal to or less than one-half of your full normal hit points. 

The crest of valor is part of a set known collectively as the raiment of valor, which also includes the periapt of valor (page 140) and the tabard of valor (page 142). When wearing all three of these items, all allies within 10 feet of you (including yourself) gain a +4 bonus on saves against fear effects. 

Cost to Create: 1, 000 gp, 80 XP, 2 days. 

Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, prayer, remove fear.
