This tiny shield is ideal for spies and other stealthy characters who need to slip in or out of tight spots. 

Description: This buckler is fashioned from silver-plated steel and has a shen lung dragon scale embedded in its center. 

Activation: The enhancement bonus and the ability to speak and understand the Spirit Tongue function while the kodate is held. Twice per day, the owner can become ethereal as a swift action. When first held, the buckler telepathically instructs the owner (simultaneously in the Spirit Tongue and Draconic) on the effects of the item and how to activate it. 

Effect: A kodate of the spirit dragon functions as a +1 buckler, and its owner can speak and understand the Spirit Tongue. When activated, the item renders its owner ethereal for 1 round, similar to the ethereal jaunt spell (PH 227).
