These leather bracers are a deep burgundy color. Close examination reveals that the left bracer is stitched in patterns of seven, while the right is stitched in patterns of eleven. 

When you cast a divine spell while wearing these bracers, you gain a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, or AC (chosen at the time you cast the spell). This bonus lasts until the start of your next turn. 

If you worship Olidammara (or any other deity that offers access to the Luck domain), the bonus instead applies to your attack rolls, saving throws, and Armor Class simultaneously. 

Cost to Create: 4, 000 gp, 320 XP, 8 days. 

Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, worshiper of Olidammara.
