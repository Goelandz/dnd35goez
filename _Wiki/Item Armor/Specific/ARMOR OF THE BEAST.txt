This suit of studded leather armor is held together with bits of hone and scale rather than metal rivets. The breastpiece is engraved with an abstract image resembling a tree, whose branches cross over the armor's shoulders. 

If you have the wild shape class feature, this suit of+1 wild studded leather armor grants you one additional use of that ability per day. (It does not, however, grant that ability if you do not already possess it. ) This extra use stacks with the one provided by a druid's vestment (DMG 268). 

Armor of the beast is part of a set known collectively as the trappings of the beast, which also includes the ring of the beast (page 141) and the mantle of the beast (page 140). 

When you wear all three of these items, you gain a +5 competence bonus on wild empathy checks. In addition, you are treated as one level higher than you are for the purpose of using wild shape. (For instance, an llth-level druid clad in the trappings of the beast could assume the form of a plant creature. ) 

Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, wild shape ability.
