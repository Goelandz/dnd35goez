This suit of +3 dragoncraft hide armor grants its wearer resistance 5 against a specific type of energy, as appropriate to the dragon from whose scales it was crafted (acid for black, copper, or green; cold for silver or white; electricity for blue or bronze; or fire for brass, gold, or red). This resistance is treated as an extraordinary (and thus nonmagical) feature of the armor.

If the wearer has the wild shape ability, she may change into a Small or Medium dragon of the same color as the armor once per day, and may remain in that form for up to 7 hours. This change doesn’t count against the character’s normal limit of daily wild shape uses.
