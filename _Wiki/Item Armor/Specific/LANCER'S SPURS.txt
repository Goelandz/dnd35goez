These silver spurs gleam brightly in the ambient light. The points on the wheels are slightly jagged, like the lightning bolts of Heironeous. 

Lancer's spurs always come in pairs, and they do not function if attached to magic footwear, since the two kinds of items occupy the same body slot. While you wear these spurs, any mount you ride gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with its natural weapons. 

If you are a paladin or other character with a special mount, and you ride that mount while wearing lancer's spurs, the enhancement bonus increases to +2, and the mount's natural weapons are treated as either good- or evil-aligned (as appropriate to your own alignment) for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If you are neutral, you must choose the alignment of the spurs when you wear them for the first time, and you cannot thereafter change your mind unless your alignment changes in such a way as to render the initial choice unsuitable. 

Cost to Create: 6, 000 gp, 480 XP, 12 days.
