Dyed a brilliant scarlet color, a crimson coat of Ilpharzz is a suit of +4 leather armor whose surface is embroidered with flame motifs in golden thread. 

As a free action, the wearer can command the armor to ignite three times per day, enveloping her in magical flames that give off light as a torch. The wearer is not harmed by these flames, gaining a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class and fire resistance 15 while they last. Any creature attacking the wearer with a natural weapon or a melee weapon that is not a reach weapon takes 1d4 points of fire damage per attack. A crimson coat can burn for up to 1 minute at a time.
