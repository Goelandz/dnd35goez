The soles of these of dust-covered sandals are worn nearly paper-thin in spots, and the cracking leather straps seem likely to crumble to dust at any moment. 

While wearing sandals of the vagabond, you gain a +2 luck bonus on initiative checks and immunity to exhaustion. You can still become fatigued normally, but any spell or effect that would cause you to become exhausted instead makes you merely fatigued. If you're already fatigued, any effect that would cause you to become exhausted merely extends your fatigue for the number of rounds the exhaustion would have applied. 

These sandals are part of a set known collectively as the garb of the vagabond, which also includes the cloak of the vagabond, the robe of the vagabond, and the staff of the vagabond. Using three or more of these items together grants extra benefits, as described in the entries for cloak of the vagabond and staff of the vagabond.
