This heavy helm covers the entire head and face. When it is worn, the image of a deity's holy symbol forms around the eye-slits. The helm of righteous war grants you a +2 insight bonus on initiative checks and Spot checks. 

As a swift action, you can sacrifice one daily turn or rebuke undead attempt; this pinpoints the current locations of all enemies within 10 feet of you (even if invisible). 

You also become immune to being flanked until the start of your next turn. This ability can be activated five times per day. 

The helm of righteous war is part of a set known collectively as regalia of righteous war, which also includes the bastion of righteous war (page 136) and the blade of righteous war (page 137). When you use all three together, you gain additional abilities as noted in the description of the bastion of righteous war. 

The holy symbol pictured on the helm always matches the deity worshiped by the wearer (if any). 

Cost to Create: 2, 500 gp, 200 XP, 5 days. 

Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, true seeing, turn or rebuke undead.
