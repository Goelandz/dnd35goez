This cloak consists of layers of tiny scales affixed to a thin leather backing. Ten varieties of this item exist, each corresponding in hue to one of the five chromatic or the five metallic dragons. While you wear the cloak, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your natural armor bonus. 

If you worship Bahamut or Tiamat (or any other draconic deity), you may activate the cloak of the dragon once per day to grow a pair of draconic wings that grants you a fly speed (equal to your land speed) for 10 minutes. While this effect is active, you may use a breath weapon (as if you were a half-dragon matching the hue of your cloak; see MM 146) once. 

Cost to Create: 3, 000 gp, 240 XP, 6 days. 

Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, polymorph, worshiper of a draconic deity.
