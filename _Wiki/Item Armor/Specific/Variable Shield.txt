 A variable shield, normally a +1 small steel shield, can change its size on mental command. As a standard action, the shield can shrink or grow from a buckler to a tower shield. All the rules for carrying items with shields apply to the new shield size (see Armor Descriptions in Chapter 7 of the Player’s Handbook). You cannot use a weapon in your hand if it also carries a small shield, and you must drop an item in that hand if you’re carrying a large or tower shield. Characters not proficient in shields take an additional –2 armor check penalty during the following round if the variable shield’s size changes during combat.
