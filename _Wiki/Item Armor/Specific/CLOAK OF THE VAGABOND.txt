This torn and tattered cloak is spattered with mud and looks to have been poorly made. Its original fabric was a particularly nauseating shade of yellow. 

While wearing the cloak of the vagabond, you gain resistance 5 to cold and fire. 

This cloak is part of a set known collectively as the garb of the vagabond, which also includes the robe of the vagabond, the sandals of the vagabond, and the staff of the vagabond. When you wear a cloak of the vagabond while using any two of the other items, it also grants you resistance 5 to electricity. When you use all four set items together, the staff of the vagabond gains an extra benefit (see page 137).
