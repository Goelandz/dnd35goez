Created for the ranger Arilus, this armor helped him eliminate several nests of medusas that infiltrated his swampy home. This +1 chain shirt is extremely polished, actually allowing someone to see their reflection in its chain links. Three times per day, the wearer can ignore the effects of any gaze attacks.
