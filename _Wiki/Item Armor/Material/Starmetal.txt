This superior alloy is made from meteoric iron—specifically, ore refi ned from meteors that fall during the rare appearances of the comet Alhazarde. 

Starmetal is extraordinarily hard, and is equal to adamantine for all purposes (see page 283 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide), including overcoming damage reduction or granting damage reduction when used in armor construction. Starmetal also possesses an inherent magical connection to the Material Plane, meaning that weapons made of the alloy are especially effective against creatures from other planes. Weapons made of starmetal deal an extra 1d6 points of damage to any extraplanar creatures while they are on the Material Plane.

 Creating a weapon from starmetal costs 5,000 gp more than creating a similar weapon of steel. Creating armor from starmetal has the same costs as armor created from adamantine.
