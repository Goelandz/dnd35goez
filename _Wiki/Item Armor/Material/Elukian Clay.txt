Although barely malleable in its natural state, this rough, gray stone can be shaped into weapons and armor in a process similar to sculpting. Also known as sea-stone, elukian clay is formed in part by seepage from the Elemental Plane of Water. It has a strong affinity to water, so those traveling in or over large bodies of water value it greatly. Items made from elukian clay do not count against the wearer’s weight total when calculating armor check penalties on Swim checks.

Although it can be shaped into a point, elukian clay does not hold an edge very well. Only piercing and bludgeoning weapons can be made from elukian clay. Armor and shields made from elukian clay have their armor check penalty increased by 1.

Once formed, an item made from elukian clay takes three days to harden. Items used before the hardening is complete are easily ruined; such items have 0 hardness and only one-tenth their normal hit points. Once dried, elukian clay items have a hardness of 10 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. 

Shaping elukian clay into armor requires the Craft (sculpture) skill.
