A shield with this quality attracts ranged weapons to it. It grants a +1 deflection bonus to Armor Class against ranged weapons as projectiles and thrown weapons veer toward the shield, not the shield bearer. Additionally, any projectile or thrown weapon aimed at a target within 5 feet of the shield’s bearer diverts from its original target and targets the shield’s bearer instead. (If the shield bearer has total cover with respect to the attacker, the projectile or thrown weapon is not diverted.) Projectiles and thrown weapons that have an enhancement bonus higher than the shield’s total bonus to AC are not diverted, but the shield’s increased AC bonus still applies against attacks directed at the bearer.

Those attacking the shield bearer with ranged weapons ignore any miss chance that would normally apply due to concealment or magical effects. The bearer activates this ability with a command word and can shut it off by repeating it.
