A focused shield helps you anticipate your enemy’s moves in battle, helps you see through feints and similar moves, and provides enhanced benefits when you are facing only one creature.

 A focused shield grants a +10 circumstance bonus on your Sense Motive check that opposes a Bluff check made to feint. In addition, any time when you are threatened by only one creature, the shield bonus to your AC provided by a focused shield improves by 1.

 This special ability can be applied only to shields, not to armor.
