This exquisitely crafted armor or shield, favored by celestial champions of good, is often set with precious gems and adorned with images of powerful archons, eladrins, or guardinals. The wearer can transfer all or part of its enhancement bonus to a sacred bonus on saving throws. The wearer decides to make the transfer on his turn, and the choice remains in effect until his next turn. Any evil creature wearing empyreal armor or holding an empyreal shield is sickened (–2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks) for as long as the armor is worn or the shield is held (no saving throw).
