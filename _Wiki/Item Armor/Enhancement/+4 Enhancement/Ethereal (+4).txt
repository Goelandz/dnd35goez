The two variations on this enchantment are for suits of armor or shields. The first allows the bearer to use the effect of an ethereal jaunt spell as if cast by a 9th-level cleric. The second allows the bearer and anyone touching him to become ethereal as if an 11thlevel cleric cast etherealness. The armor or shield appears insubstantial and unreal, except on the Ethereal Plane where it appears completely normal.
