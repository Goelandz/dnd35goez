The wearer of this pristine armor, if good, takes only half of the extra damage dealt by an unholy weapon (+1d6 instead of +2d6) and gains the benefits of a constant protection from evil spell. Furthermore, the armor negates the vile damage dealt by a vile melee, ranged, or natural weapon (described in the Book of Vile Darkness).
