A favorite of rangers and bounty hunters, bane blind armor grants improved invisibility to the wearer against a specific creature type chosen when the armor is created. Creatures who are subject to the bane blind find that their scent ability is likewise unable to detect the wearer, although hearing, tremorsense, and other sensing methods still work. Any category of creature on the ranger’s favored enemy list can be chosen for the bane blind effect.
