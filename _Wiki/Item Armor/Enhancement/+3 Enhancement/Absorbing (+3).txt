Armor and shields with this enchantment are always a dull black, and appear to possess depths that couldn't exist. A suit of armor or a shield with this enchantment absorbs ability-draining and level-draining attacks. It can absorb as many points of ability damage or levels drained per day as its enhancement bonus. It allows Fortitude saves against energydrain attacks that normally don't allow such saves. A successful save means the attack has half effect. Absorbing armor or a shield does not change saves against attacks that already allow them.
