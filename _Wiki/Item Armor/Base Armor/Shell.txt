This armor is created out of specially treated tortoise shells and more exotic sea life. The armormaking process softens the shells, making them far more pliable and likely to bend instead of shatter when struck. Shell armor includes a breastplate, shoulder guards, and even gauntlets created from smaller and smaller shells. Druids can wear shell armor without losing access to their spells or class features.
