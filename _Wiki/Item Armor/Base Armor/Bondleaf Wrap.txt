Bondleaf wraps are each crafted from a single enormous leaf found on magical trees. A bondleaf wrap is inactive until worn for 24 hours. During this time, it grows into the skin, drawing water and nutrients from its host. Afterward, as a standard action, you can command it to wrap around your body.
