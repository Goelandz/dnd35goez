Found almost exclusively among dwarven kingdoms, this extremely rare armor is created from thin sheets of a specially treated stone resembling marble. Dwarven stone armor is very heavy and more ornamental than practical; consequently it is the dress uniform for many dwarven defenders. It provides impressive protection, as long as the person wearing it does not plan on moving very fast. Dwarven stone armor includes greaves and helmet, but not gauntlets.
