Wicker armor is the poor soldier’s last resort. Tightly woven reeds cover the entire body, offering slightly more protection than normal clothes, although the wicker is bulky and loud. The main advantage of wicker armor is its low cost and light weight. Clever armorsmiths sometimes weave thorns into the wicker, effectively creating spiked armor.
