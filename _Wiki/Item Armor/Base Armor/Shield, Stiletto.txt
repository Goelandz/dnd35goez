This small wooden shield has a special switch located on the inside grip. When triggered, four blades pop out from the edges of the shield, and one larger blade springs out from the middle. Triggering and retracting the blades is a free action.

When the blades are activated, the stiletto shield counts as a spiked shield in all respects.
