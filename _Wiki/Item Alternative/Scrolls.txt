SCROLLS
Unlike potions, scrolls require magical training (or the ability to mimic such training by means of the Use Magic Device skill) to use properly. The essential characteristics of a scroll are as follows.
• Single-use only—once it is read, the writing that makes up a scroll is gone.
• Spell completion device—only a spellcaster can readily use a scroll, and he might need to make a level check to read a scroll of a spell level exceeding the maximum level of spell he can normally cast.
• Usable by means of the Use Magic Device skill.
• Must be physically manipulated in a complex way (held in the hand, unrolled, and read).
• Must be in the user’s hand to be used.
• Use provokes attacks of opportunity.

 Some common alternate scroll forms are described below.

Gemstone: A complex series of gestures and sounds is completed with a specially prepared gemstone in hand, and the spell stored within it is released when the final words are spoken. Like the parchment on which a scroll is scribed, a gemstone is emptied by casting but can be reused again.

Incendiary: A spell is stored in a special mix of powders and glyph-covered paper. To use an incendiary, a spellcaster speaks the last words of the spell while simultaneously igniting the prepared device (usually by means of a minor magical property of the incendiary form that requires no additional action to activate). The incendiary is consumed in a brilliant colored fl ash or haze of strangely coiling smoke, completing the 
spell.

Macrame: A spell is held in a small, complex weave of precisely tied knots. The user pulls apart the knotted square by choosing the right strands while speaking the spell’s activation words.

 When a scroll is found in the course of a campaign, deciphering its magical text is usually the first step to using it, but since variant scroll forms that don’t have spells stored in written form can’t be deciphered with read magic, they must be identifi ed with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level)
