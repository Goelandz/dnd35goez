This stunning piece of jewelry is virtually priceless based simply on its artistic quality and the value of precious metal and gemstones it contains, but its magical abilities are even more valuable to a dragon. When worn by a dragon, an amulet of supremacy confers the benefits of the Maximize Breath feat on the dragon’s breath weapon, and applies the effects of the Maximize Spell feat to the dragon’s spells and spell-like abilities. These benefits come at no cost to the dragon: It need not wait extra rounds between uses of its breath weapon, and its maximized spells do not use higher-level spell slots. 

An amulet of supremacy bestows two negative levels on any nondragon that dares to put it on. In addition, when a nondragon first dons the amulet, it immediately targets the offender with a disintegrate effect (caster level 20th, Fortitude DC 19 partial).
Strong (no school); CL 17th.
