The lenses of this item are made of silvered crystal. When they are placed over the eyes, the wearer can operate without penalty in preternaturally bright light, such as might result from a flare, sunbeam, or sunburst spell. Vampires wearing goggles of day have a full-round action before dissolution when confronted with sunlight, as opposed to just a partial action.
