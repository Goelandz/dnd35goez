This sparkling, silvery dust is created by several different fey but primarily used by pixies. It comes in long, thin, silvery tubes. A single tube’s contents finely coat a 5-foot square, and any passage through the area stirs up the dust for 1d6 rounds.

Alternatively, the contents of a tube can be blown at a target creature as a ranged touch attack (maximum range 5 feet). A creature that stirs up the dust or is targeted by someone wielding a tube of the dust must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 15) or begin shrinking to the size of a grig (Tiny). In addition, the creature acts as though under the effect of a charm person spell from a 9th-level caster, obeying the person who spread the dust. Both effects last for 9 hours before restoring the person to normal.
