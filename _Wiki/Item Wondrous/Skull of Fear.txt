This ebony skull is fashioned so it can be mounted on armor, a weapon haft, or a staff or pole. It gives the wearer or wielder an aura of fear, so that anyone coming within 10 feet is affected as if by a fear spell (Will DC 16 negates). The wearer or wielder can raise or lower the aura with a command word.
