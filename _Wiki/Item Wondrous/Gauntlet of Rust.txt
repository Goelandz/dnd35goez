Gauntlet of Rust (11,500 gp)

This gauntlet has many uses in a dungeon. It can rust a locked door off its hinges, destroy the clasps on a treasure chest, ruin any trap that has metal parts, break through a portcullis, sever a chain, or cause prison bars to crumble. You can use it only once a day, but the effect lasts for 7 rounds, so before you slip it on, be sure you have more than one potential use within walking distance. If you expect to encounter golems, let the party’s wizard wear the gauntlet of rust. Otherwise, the golem’s immunity to magic might keep her on the sidelines.
