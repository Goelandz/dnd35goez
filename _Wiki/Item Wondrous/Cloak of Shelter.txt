This plain but sturdy-looking cloak provides excellent protection against wind, cold, sun, and rain. On command, the cloak turns itself into a 4-person tent. This tent includes an alarm spell (as if cast by a 7th-level sorcerer) but is otherwise normal. Once per day, the cloak can turn into a small lodge, as Leomund’s secure shelter.
