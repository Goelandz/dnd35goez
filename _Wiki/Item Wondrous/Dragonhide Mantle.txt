A dragon’s hide can be rendered flexible enough to wear as a cloak. Crafting a dragonhide mantle requires as much hide as a suit of hide armor, and the mantle must be created to fit the wearer’s size.

A dragonhide mantle grants the wearer resistance 5 against a specific type of energy, as appropriate to the dragon (acid for black, copper, or green; cold for silver or white; electricity for blue or bronze; fire for brass, gold, or red). This resistance is treated as an extraordinary (and thus nonmagical) feature of the mantle. It doesn’t stack with any other energy resistance (of the same type) possessed by the character.

In addition, the wearer of a dragonhide mantle gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks against dragons.
