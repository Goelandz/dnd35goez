Dust of Dryness (850 gp): 

This item is a good answer to the popular room-fi lling-with-water trap. In most cases, dust of dryness will not stop the water from rising to the ceiling, but soaking up 100 gallons will buy you extra time to fi nd another way out. As a bonus, the resultant pebble can later be thrown into a room of monsters to fl ood them out.
