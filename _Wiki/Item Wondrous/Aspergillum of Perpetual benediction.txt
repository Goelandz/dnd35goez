This small silver shaft has a hollow ball at one end. Tiny holes in the ball allow holy water to emerge from the font within. 

You can use this vessel to dispense small amounts of holy water. The I reservoir holds a pint of holy water, even though it does not appear large enough to contain such a quantity. Every dawn, an aspergillum of perpetual benediction refills itself, ensuring you a nearly endless supply of holy water. Holy water dispensed from this item loses its blessing after 24 hours. 

Chaotic, evil, and lawful versions of the aspergillum exist as well, though they are far less common. 

Cost to Create: 750 gp, 60 XP, 2 days.
