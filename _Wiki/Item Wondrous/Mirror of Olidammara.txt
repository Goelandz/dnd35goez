This symbol looks like a plain silver hand mirror, but anyone who looks into the glass sees a theatrical mask with half the face dark and smiling and the other half white and scowling. This image is not magical in nature the glass is not a mirror, and the mask is simply embedded in the backing. 

When held forth during the casting of Luck domain spells or spells that have the chaotic descriptor, the mirror of Olidammara increases your effective caster level by 1.
