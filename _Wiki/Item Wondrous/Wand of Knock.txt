Wand of Knock (4,500 gp)

A skilled rogue is more valuable than a limited-use magic item, but it never hurts to have an option for those really tough locks. A chime of opening might be cheaper at only 3,000 gp, but it has a mere 10 uses compared to the wand’s 50 charges.

If you are a rogue, keep a wand of knock up your sleeve at all times, and you will be one successful Use Magic Device check away from a reputation as a lockpicking miracle worker.
