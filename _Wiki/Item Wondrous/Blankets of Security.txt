In case of nocturnal ambush, a set of blankets of security allows you to awaken five people with a single uttered phrase.

Activation: You fall asleep under a blanket of securityas you would under any normal blanket. Activating the blanket’s magic requires a command word, which can be spoken as a free action. The same command word or phrase activates all blankets in a set, allowing whoever is on night watch to wake the rest of the party quickly. Typical command words might be “Rise and shine,” “Danger lurks,” or the simple but effective “Wake up!”
