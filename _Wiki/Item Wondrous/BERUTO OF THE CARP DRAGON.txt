Description: Decorated with seashells. this hemp belt has a buckle fashioned from a yu lung dragon scale. 

Activation: A beruto of the carp dragon functions continuously while worn, occupying the same body slot as a belt. When first donned, it telepathically instructs the wearer (simultaneously in the Spirit Tongue and Draconic) on the effects of the item and how to activate it. 

Effect: The wearer gains the ability to breathe water normally but loses the ability to breathe air. He also gains a swim speed equal to his base land speed, along with the other benefits of having a swim speed (see Movement Modes, MM 311). After removing the beruto of the carp dragon, the wearer resumes breathing air.
