These metal, scythelike blades are designed to fit over one set of a dragon’s claws, and they resize to fit any dragon of Large size or bigger. A dragon wearing claws of the ripper cannot also make use of a magic ring on that claw. When worn, claws of the ripper increase the damage dealt by the dragon’s claws on a critical hit, giving them a ×4 multiplier (like that of a scythe).
