Some adventurers never seem to have enough rope. A spool of endless rope contains an unlimited amount of the fi nest silk rope, yet the whole spool weighs only a single pound. The spool comes with a belt loop so that it can be hung conveniently at an adventurer’s side.

 To use a spool of endless rope, the owner feeds out as little or as much rope as desired, up to a maximum of 500 feet at any one time. When fi nished with the rope, the owner can simply wind it back onto the spool. (Feeding out or rewinding requires 1 round per 50 feet of rope.)  The rope can’t be entirely separated from the spool, though it can be cut or broken as a normal silk rope can be. Any portion of rope cut away from the spool disappears instantly, but the spool immediately replenishes the missing rope.

The rope from a spool of endless rope can be spliced or knotted together with another rope (including a rope from a second spool of endless rope), but the rope can’t be wound back into the spool while so attached.
