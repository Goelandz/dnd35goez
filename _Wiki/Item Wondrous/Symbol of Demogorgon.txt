This unholy symbol, dedicated to the Prince of Demons, is worn as an amulet. It provides a +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and allows the owner to cast rotting curse of Urfestra with no corruption cost. The caster must still prepare the spell normally; if he does not prepare spells, this aspect of the symbol cannot be used.
