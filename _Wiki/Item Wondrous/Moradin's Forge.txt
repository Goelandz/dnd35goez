Usually made of a heavy metal (lead, adamantine, or even gold) and painted flat black, this talisman comes in two parts—a model hammer and a tiny anvil. 

Most crafters attach the two parts with a thin but strong and flexible wire, so that the hammer can be struck against the anvil during casting. Doing so isn't strictly necessary, but many worshipers of the Soul Forger feel the action 
is appropriate. 

When used to cast Earth domain spells or spells that have the earth descriptor, Moradin's forge increases the save DC by 1. In addition, it increases your effective caster level by 1 when used to turn or rebuke air creatures (as the Earth domain granted power).
