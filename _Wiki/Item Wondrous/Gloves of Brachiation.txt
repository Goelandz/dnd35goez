These tight leather gloves allow the wearer to travel from branch to branch using only her arms, as a monkey or gibbon would. As long as she is at medium encumbrance or less, the wearer can move at her full speed through the tree canopy. The wearer also gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Jump checks as long as she is aboveground (leaping from tree branch to tree branch, for example).
