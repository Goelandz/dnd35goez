This broad belt seems to be nothing more than a well-made article of clothing, but closer examination reveals eight small pouches along its inner front. In fact, a total of sixty-four extradimensional pouches exist in the belt, with seven more “behind’’ each of the eight readily apparent ones. Each pouch is similar to a miniature bag of holding, able to contain up to 1 cubic foot of material weighing as much as 10 pounds. In addition, if the wearer has a familiar, any pouch can hold it no matter what its size or weight. The familiar has no need for food, water, or air while inside the pouch, but any other living creature of suitable size placed within a pocket has enough air for only 1 minute, after which it suffocates.

 Anything stored in the belt’s pockets is effectively weightless and doesn’t affect the wearer’s carrying capacity so long as the belt is worn around the waist. If removed, the belt weighs one-tenth of the total weight of all the items stored within it.

 While worn around the waist, the belt responds to its wearer’s desire to extract something (by opening the correct pouch) or store something (by opening an empty pouch).

Retrieving a specifi c item from the pouch is a move action, but doesn’t provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.
