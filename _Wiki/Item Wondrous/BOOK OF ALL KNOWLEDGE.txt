The pages of this enormous tome are rough-edged and yellowed. 

Embossed on the worn, blue leather cover is the holy symbol of Boccob. 

A book of all knowledge is said to contain all the secrets of the world, but few mortals are capable of accessing all that information. Its pages are apparently infinite; no matter how many you turn, more still remain unturned. Once per day, you can attempt a single Knowledge check (as if you were trained) with a +10 insight bonus after perusing the book for 2d4 hours. 

If you're a worshiper of Boccob (or any deity that offers access to the Knowledge domain), the time required is only ld4 hours. 

Cost to Create: 1, 500 gp, 120 XP, 3 days. 

Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, lore of the gods*', worshiper of Boccob.
