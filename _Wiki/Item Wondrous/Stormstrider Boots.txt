These mystical boots allow you, when making a spring attack, to transform into a bolt of lightning, blasting your foes and transporting yourself across the battlefield. 

Description: These are simple boots of soft leather, a light brown in hue. Gold stitching surrounds the cuffs. For a split second before stormstnder boots activate, the stitching flashes and crackles with power, and the boots smell of ozone for a round after use.

Prerequisite: These boots function only for characters who have the Spring Attack feat.

Activation: Activating the primary function of the boots is a swift action that you can take only when initiating a spring attack. This function works once per day. The bonus to your land speed requires no activation; it applies as long as the boots are worn.

Effect: Before and after making the attack as part of your spring attack, you become pure lightning. You can move through occupied squares during your spring attack, and any creature in a square you move through takes 9d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 17 half). Moving through a creature's space more than once during your spring attack doesn't have any additional effect.

You rematerialize briefly at a single point during your spring attack, enabling you to make a single attack as normal.

Stormstrider boots also provide a 5-foot enhancement bonus to your land speed.
