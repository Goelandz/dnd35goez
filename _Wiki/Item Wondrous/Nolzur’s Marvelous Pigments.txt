Nolzur’s Marvelous Pigments (4,000 gp)

With these pigments, the possibilities are endless. Create any piece of equipment needed without having to hike back to the surface. Reshape the dungeon environment to your advantage by painting doors, pits, stairs, ladders, ropes, bridges, traps, windows, barriers, pulleys, or whatever you can imagine. Better yet, conserve the pigments by thinking small. Paint a peephole to spy on monsters in the next room, or a crack down the middle of a door to facilitate battering. Alchemical items are fair game, too, so doodle yourself a tanglefoot bag when you need it. And when you absolutely must incinerate a monster, paint a giant pit of lava—but make sure to use it soon, because without a natural source of geothermic heat, it will cool down in about an hour.
