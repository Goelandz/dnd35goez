Boots of Levitation (7,500 gp)

The benefits of being able to move vertically in a dungeon are obvious. But boots of levitation have a rare advantage—they can be used at will. However, they are not much use in combat, so try wearing some other magic footwear (such as boots of striding and springing) most of the time, and swap them for boots of levitation when presented with an obstacle. Because the boots have unlimited usage, you can take them off when you reach the top (or the bottom) of the obstacle and throw them back to your allies so that they can catch up with you, one at a time.
