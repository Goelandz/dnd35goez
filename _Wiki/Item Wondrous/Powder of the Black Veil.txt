 A pinch of this sooty, black powder cast into an area creates a 10-foot-high cloud in a 10-foot spread centered on the user. The cloud remains in place for 2d4 rounds, and any creature caught in the area (or one that enters it) is blinded for as long as it stays in the cloud and for 1d4 rounds after it leaves unless it succeeds on a DC 13 Will save.
