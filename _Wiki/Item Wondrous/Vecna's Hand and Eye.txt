The typical worshiper of Vecna keeps her holy symbol hidden until it is time to cast spells. The talisman of the God of Secrets looks like a dark hand grasping a large, bloodshot eye. Alternatively, sometimes the hand's fingers are outstretched, and the eye is embedded in the palm. Either way, the disquieting symbol represents both the deity and the artifacts that bear his name. 

When used to cast any spell from the Knowledge or Magic domain, Vecna's hand and eye increases your effective caster level and the save DCs by 1.
