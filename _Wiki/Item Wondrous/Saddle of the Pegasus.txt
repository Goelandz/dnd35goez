This exquisitely crafted saddle is heavily adorned with the feathers from pegasi wings. The saddle adjusts to fit any normalsized horse, donkey, or mule. When securely placed, it allows the steed and rider to fly (as the fly spell from a 5th-level caster, except maneuverability is clumsy) three times per day upon command. The saddle acts as an exotic military saddle for the rider.

The first time someone uses this saddle on a steed untrained in flying, the rider must make a DC 15 Ride check to keep the steed from panicking.
