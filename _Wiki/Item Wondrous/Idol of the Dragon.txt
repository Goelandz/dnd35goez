Much like a figurine of wondrous power, an idol of the dragon is a miniature statuette (about 2 inches long) resembling a particular variety of dragon. The color and kind of the dragon is very apparent, even at a glance, due to the craftsmanship involved. The idol grants energy resistance (5 or 10) of the appropriate type to its owner while carried (but not while the idol is in dragon form).

Once per week, when the idol is tossed into the air and the proper command word spoken, it becomes a full-size dragon of the appropriate age (see the table below). The dragon is a living creature, not a construct, and has all the abilities and powers of an average dragon of its age. The dragon obeys and serves its owner for up to 1 hour. At the end of this duration, or if it is prematurely dismissed by its owner, the dragon returns to idol form. A targeted dispel magic on the full-size dragon can return it to idol form if successful. If the dragon is slain while at full size, the idol is destroyed.
