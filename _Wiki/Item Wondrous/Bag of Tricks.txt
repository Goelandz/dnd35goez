Bag of Tricks (gray, 900 gp)

With this item, you enjoy the benefi t of having a small animal companion that can scout dungeon corridors without worrying about the drawbacks if it is slain. Few monsters will react to the presence of a rat or a bat; such creatures probably infest the dungeon already. A more callous PC might also use an animal from a bag of tricks to search for traps the old-fashioned way—namely, sending the critter down a hallway and seeing if it gets zapped.
