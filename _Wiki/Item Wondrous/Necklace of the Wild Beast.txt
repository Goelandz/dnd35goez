A necklace of this sort appears to be a normal piece of nonvaluable jewelry until it is placed about the neck of a character capable of casting animal friendship. The necklace of the wild beast has one or more special beads.

Special Bead Type 		Special Bead Ability
Bead of calming 		Wearer can cast calm animals.
Bead of servitude 		Wearer can cast dominate animal.
Bead of the fang 		Wearer can cast greater magic fang.
Bead of beckoning 		Wearer can cast summon nature’s ally IV.
Bead of the great beast 	Wearer can cast animal growth.
Bead of awakening 		Wearer can cast awaken.

Each special bead can be used only once, and then becomes forever inert. The power of a special bead is lost if removed from the necklace.
