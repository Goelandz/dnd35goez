This dark, viscous fluid is usually stored in a small stoppered bottle and applied like a perfume. One round after exposure to air, it creates an invisible cloud of poison gas in a 10-foot radius that lasts for 1 minute. The creature wearing the aroma of curdled deathis protected from the cloud’s effect, but all other exposed creatures with 3 Hit Dice or less die with no save. Creatures with 4 to 6 Hit Dice must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save each round they are exposed to the effect or die (taking 1d4 points of Constitution damage on a successful save), and creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice take 1d4 points of Constitution damage (Fortitude DC 17 half). The cloud moves as the creature does.

 If the bottle is opened but the liquid within not immediately applied to a creature, the cloud of poison gas that forms spreads to fi ll only a 5-foot radius, centered on the opened bottle or the place the liquid was poured out. This cloud also lasts for 1 minute.
