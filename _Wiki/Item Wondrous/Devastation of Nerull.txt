This symbol is either carved from bone or made from the skeleton of a Diminutive creature, and it always appears to be decaying. Worshipers of Nerull typically either grow lichen on it, or whet it with a small amount of acid. As a result, it usually carries a mildly unpleasant odor. 

When used to cast a spell from the necromancy school or the Death domain, or when brandished to rebuke or command (not turn or destroy) unintelligent undead, this symbol increases your effective caster level by 1.
