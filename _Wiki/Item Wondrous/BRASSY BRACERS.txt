These bracers sear enemies with boiling heat while diverting their attacks.
 
Description: This pair of brass dragon scales, each about the size and shape of a man's fist, are edged in mithral and set with moonstones in a spiral pattern. Affixed to the back of each is a buckle and leather strap so they can be worn on the forearms. 

Activation: Once per day, the wearer can create a shield of superheated air with a purely mental swift action. Anyone donning the brassy bracers receives mental instructions in Draconic on the effects of the item and how to activate it. 

Effect: Activating the brassy bracers surrounds the wearer in a swirling shield of superheated air for up to 10 rounds. The shimmering heat waves provide concealment for him, imposing a 20% miss chance on attacks made against him. The wearer can deactivate the effect as a standard action. 

In addition, the heat deals 2d6 points of fire damage to any creatures striking the wearer with a natural attack or nonreach melee weapon. The wearer is immune to the heat damage of his own bracers.
