Always made from living wood and green leaves, this symbol remains fresh as long as you remain alive and pay homage to the nature god. Only upon close inspection can nonworshipers see the face hidden amid the leaves. 

When used to cast spells from the Animal or Plant domain, Obad-Hai's green man increases your caster level by 2. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus on turn or rebuke checks made against plant creatures while brandishing it.
