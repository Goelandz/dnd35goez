Despite its sharp point, this dark green, dagger-sized thorn makes a poor weapon because it is too brittle and fragile. However, when it breaks against the flesh of a good-aligned outsider (requiring a touch attack), it releases terrible energy that stuns the target for 1d4 rounds (no save, but spell resistance applies).
