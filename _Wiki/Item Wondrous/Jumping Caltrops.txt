These unusual items are actually Diminutive animated objects. When released from their bag, they begin hopping around the 5-foot square in which they land. When someone tries to move into, through, or within that square on foot, the jumping caltrops immediately try to scurry under the interloper’s feet. Jumping caltrops can’t move from the square in which they land.

 The number of caltrop attacks a creature is subject to while within the affected area depends on its current speed: four if it moved into the square at normal speed, two if it moved into the square at half speed, and none if it moved into the square at one-quarter speed or less. (One-quarter speed assumes that the creature is shuffling forward without picking up its feet.) The target’s shield, armor, and deflection bonuses don’t count against these attacks. A target that is wearing shoes or other footwear, however, gets a +2 bonus to AC. The speed of any target that takes damage from the caltrop attack is reduced to one-half normal because of the foot injury.

 Once they are released, jumping caltrops continue to move for 11 rounds, though the owner can order them back into the bag before the duration expires if desired. However, they can move (and thus attack on their own) only upon their first use; thereafter, they become normal caltrops.
