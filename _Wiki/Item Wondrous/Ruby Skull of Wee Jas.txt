 This stylized symbol carved from ruby resembles a skull stretched and twisted by magic. Its empty eye sockets stare unceasingly at the viewer. 

When used as a focus for Death domain or necromancy spells, a ruby skull of Wee Jas increases your effective caster level by 1. In addition, when used to rebuke or command (not turn or destroy) undead, it grants a +1 bonus on your turning damage rolls.
