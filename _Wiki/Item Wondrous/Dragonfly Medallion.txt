This silver dragonflyshaped medallion is covered with precious gems. It grants the Improved Initiative feat while worn. If the wearer already has this feat, it grants an additional +1 competence bonus on Initiative rolls. 

Once per day, the medallion can transform into a Large dragonfly to attack at the command of its owner. The owner can give mental commands to the dragonfly from up to 200 feet away. If the dragonfly is slain in its vermin form, then the medallion is destroyed as well. If the owner is killed, knocked unconscious, or taken out of range while the medallion is in dragonfly form, it converts back into a medallion immediately.
