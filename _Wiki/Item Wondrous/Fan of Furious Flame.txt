This collapsible fan is made of thin red iron and resembles licking flames when opened. Three times per day, the fan can create a cone 30 feet long that causes any open flames, including candles, torches, or lanterns, to explode in a burst of fire and deal the indicated damage (Reflex half DC 15).

Flame Size 		Damage 		Area
Candles (1–5) 		1d4 		5-ft. diameter
Candelabra (6+) 	1d6 		5-ft. diameter
Lantern 		1d8 		5-ft. square
Torch 			1d10 		10-ft. square 
Campfire 		1d12 		10-ft. square 

All fire that explodes in this way is permanently extinguished. The explosion occurs too quickly for nearby combustibles to catch on fire. The fan of furious flame has no effect on magical fires such as those created by continual flame.
