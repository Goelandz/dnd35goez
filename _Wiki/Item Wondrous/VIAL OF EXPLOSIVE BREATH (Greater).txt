A lesser vial of explosive breath holds a tightly controlled quantity of energy not unlike a dragon's breath weapon. Prized by dragons and their allies alike, this item offers a surprise for those who think they know what to expect from a foe. 

Description: This smoky crystal vial is closed with a golden stopper, capped by a faintly glowing piece of clear quartz. When it shatters, destructive magical energy explodes outward, looking very much like a dragon unfolding its wings before dissipating into thin air. 

Activation: A creature can throw a lesser vial of explosive breath as an attack, either as a standard action or as part of a full attack action. Hurling the vial as a ranged attack provokes attacks of opportunity. 

Effect: A greater vial of explosive breath is hurled as a splash weapon and must be aimed at a grid intersection. Upon impact, the vial shatters, releasing the energy of its breath weapon in a 20-foot-radius spread centered upon the point of impact. A greater version of this item can be crafted by true dragons of ancient age or older. A greater vial of explosive breath deals 10d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 22 half).
