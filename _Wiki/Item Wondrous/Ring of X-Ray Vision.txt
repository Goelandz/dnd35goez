Ring of X-Ray Vision (25,000 gp)

Use this ring to peer through every door before you open it or to see the internal workings of a trap before you attempt to disarm it. In addition, secret doors are practically impossible to miss. But unless you have immunity to Constitution damage—such as if you are undead or a construct—take care not to exceed the ring’s 10-minute time limit. Instead, create a homunculus that can wear the ring, and you will have the perfect scout: a Tiny flying servant with unlimited X-ray vision that can relate all it sees back to you telepathically.
