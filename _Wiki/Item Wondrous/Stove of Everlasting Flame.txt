Tired of hearing adventurers complain about not being able to start a fire in the middle of rainstorms or underground, an enterprising mage created the first of these handy devices for cooking food.

This enclosed metal box easily fits in the palm of someone’s hand. It has two metal flaps on one end that pop open to reveal a continuously burning flame. The heat of the flame is equivalent to a torch, although the flame’s size (and the light it produces) is the same as a candle. The metal of the box remains slightly warm to the touch, whether the flaps are open or not.
