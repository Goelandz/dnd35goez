If an evil outsider looks into this small, octagonal mirror, the mirror dispels any illusion spells or effects that conceal the true nature of the outsider. This effect functions as a targeted dispel magic cast by a 10th-level cleric. If the outsider is wary or attempts to avert its gaze, treat the situation as a gaze attack (see page 77 of the DUNGEON MASTER'S Guide).
