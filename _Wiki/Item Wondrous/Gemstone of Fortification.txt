This large, faceted stone must be embedded in a creature’s hide to function. True dragons can accomplish this with ease, since they routinely embed gems in among the scales of their bellies. Other creatures have a more difficult time of it, requiring at least a limited wish, at the DM’s discretion.

When properly embedded, a gemstone of fortification protects the wearer’s vital areas from lethal damage. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the wearer, there is a chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. A gemstone of light fortification has a 25% chance to negate a critical hit or sneakattack, a gemstone of moderate fortification has a 75% chance, and a gemstone of heavy fortification has a 100% chance.
