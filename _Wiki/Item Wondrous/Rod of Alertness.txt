Rod of Alertness (85,000 gp)

A rod of alertness is probably one of the best magic items for protecting PCs while they rest or sleep, and it practically eliminates the need to keep watch. But do not overlook its ability to animate up to eleven Small objects. Such items might not be terribly effective in combat, but they make great trap-springers.
