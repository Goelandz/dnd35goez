Created by tritons, these backpacks are made from single giant shells. They have been magically treated to keep anything placed inside perfectly dry and protected from pressures of the ocean. Due to the shape and composition of the shell, it does not hinder the wearer’s ability to swim underwater.

Some versions of this magical device are enchanted  with gust of wind, allowing Tiny or smaller air-breathing creatures to survive inside the shell.
