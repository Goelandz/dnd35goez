This large glass jar has been magically treated to preserve any organic material placed in it. The jar can hold the equivalent of 2 gallons of liquid. Anything small enough to fit in the jar does not rot, age, or wilt. The lid must be placed securely on the top for the effect to work.

A Tiny or smaller creature can be placed in the jar, but without a supply of air and food it eventually dies, although the corpse never rots.
