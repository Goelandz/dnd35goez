This handy earring makes it easier for its wearer to cross difficult terrain. 

Description: This large, gaudy earring is fashioned from a peacocklike quill of a li lung dragon and decorated with jade beads and pieces of red coral. 

Activation: An iyaringu functions continuously while worn, occupying space on the body as a hat or headband. When first worn, it telepathically instructs the wearer (simultaneously in the Spirit Tongue and Draconic) on the effects of the item and how to activate it. 

Effect: An iyaringu of the earth dragon grants sure tooting, allowing the wearer to move at his normal speed through bogs, rubble, and undergrowth (see DMG Chapter 3 for more details on terrain). He can remain standing even during an earthquake. 

The earring has the same effect when the wearer encounters similar magical obstacles, but it does not negate any damage that might be dealt. For example, the wearer is not reduced to half speed in the area of a spike stones spell, but he still takes 1d8 points of damage for every 5 feet of movement.
