Sometimes the deities of evil mark an individual as one of their own. A mark of apostasy may be of any material but is generally made from the same material as the deity's favored weapon. It is a large symbol, roughly 8 inches across. A mark has mixed benefits. On one hand, it is instantly recognizable to anyone who sees it as a mark of evil. On the other, it increases the bearer's ability to rebuke undead by giving him the Empower Turning feat and allows him to cast fear three times per day as a 10th-level wizard. A mark of apostasy cannot be created. It is a "gift."
