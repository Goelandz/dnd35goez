A trinket of trickery makes you trickier than you already are.

Description: Trinkets of trickery can take the form of any small baubles, totems, or lucky charms. A popular shape is that of a stylized cat sitting on its haunches and waving, but many such items resemble chess pieces or figurines of mounted knights and dragons. A trinket of trickery is never larger than 1 inch in its longest dimension.

Prerequisite: You must know at least one skill trick to use a trinket of trickery.

Activation: You must wear a trinket of trickery on your person for at least 24 hours to attune it to you. After that time, the trinket grants its power to you as long it is on your person (in a pocket, held on a necklace around the neck, attached to a helmet, and so on). It does not grant its power if stored within a backpack, bag of holding, or similar location; it must be in close physical contact in some way (though it doesn’t take up space on your body).

Effect: A trinket of trickery holds the secret knowledge of a single skill trick (see page 83 for a list). You can use that trick as if you had spent skill points to learn it, but only if you meet the prerequisite for learning the trick.You can’t gain the benefit of more than one trinket of trickery simultaneously; if you wear a second trinket while one is already on your body, the second has no effect.
