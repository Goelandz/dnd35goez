This tiny blue vial contains a small amount of constantly moving water. When poured into a pool of water at least a foot deep, the droplets cause the pool to bubble and froth furiously.

In 1d4+1 rounds, an equal number of Small water elementals emerge from the pool. The elementals are not under any control, although they can be controlled later through charm monster or other magic. They attack the nearest creature or creatures, continuing their rampage until destroyed or banished.
