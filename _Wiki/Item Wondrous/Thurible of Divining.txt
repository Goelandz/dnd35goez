This perforated metal vessel usually comes in the shape of a deity’s holy symbol or some totem creature associated with a deity or cult. If it is filled with incense and lighted, the thurible produces the effect of a prayer spell for as long as the incense burns. A character wielding the lighted thurible can also trigger the following spells:
• Three times per day: detect magic, detect good, or detect law. The user can use one effect three times, each effect once, or any other combination of effects totaling three uses per day. Some thuribles may detect other alignments.
• Once per day: augury or locate object.
• Once per week: divination or true seeing.
• Once per month: commune.
