This strange device consists of a flat metal plate about 6 inches square lined with barbed hooks. A thin, flexible tube extends from the plate to an adjustable nozzle that could attach to a variety of flasks, bottles, or other containers. Over the course of one day, this device can extract pain in liquid form from a creature being tortured or otherwise suffering terrible physical torment. This physical manifestation of pain can be used to power magical items or enhance spells (see Pain as Power in Chapter 2). It can also be used as a potent drug.
