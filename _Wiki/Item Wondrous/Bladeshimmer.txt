A silvery oil, bladeshimmer causes nonliving objects on which it is smeared to turn invisible.

Description: Most often found in small vials full of what looks like quicksilver, bladeshimmer is a thin, magical oil. When it is smeared over a weapon or other object, the materials making up the object become wholly transparent.

Activation: You can coat a weapon or other object of similar size with bladeshimmer as a full-round action.

Effect: Bladeshimmer renders an object invisible. Anyone holding an affected object appears to have an empty hand, though keen eyes can spot something out of place.Use the bearer’s Sleight of Hand check result (with a +10 competence bonus) as the DC for the observer’s Spot check.

If you attack with a weapon coated with bladeshimmer, the target is considered flat-footed unless it succeeds on a Spot check to notice something unusual. A single successful attack wipes away enough bladeshimmer to end the invisibility effect.

  A single vial of this substance can coat an area up to 2 feet square. It can’t be divided between multiple objects, though multiple vials can combine to make a larger object invisible. Each doubling of the area to be affected requires four times as much bladeshimmer (four vials for an area 4 feet square, and so forth) and takes a correspondingly longer time to apply.Bladeshimmer has no effect on creatures—even undead and constructs cannot be rendered invisible with 
this substance.
