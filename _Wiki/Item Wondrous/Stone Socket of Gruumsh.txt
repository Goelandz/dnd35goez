Orcs and other worshipers of Gruumsh sometimes carve these holy symbols out of stone, making them look like empty eye sockets. During the consecration rituals, they pour blood (usually taken from the eyes of their sacrificial victims) into the hole to stain the stone permanently. 

When used to cast War domain spells or spells that have the evil descriptor, a stone socket of Gruumsh grants a bonus equal to +1 per damage die on damage rolls made for the spells. However, this bonus cannot increase a spell's damage beyond its normal limit. So if used with spiritual weapon, which normally deals damage equal to ld8 points +1 point/three caster levels, the stone socket of Gruumsh grants a +1 bonus on the damage roll. However, that bonus cannot bring the damage above 8 points for a lst-level caster, or above 13 | points (ld8+5 maximum) for a 15th-level caster.
