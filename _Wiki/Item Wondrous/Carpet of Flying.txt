Carpet of Flying (20,000 gp or more)

Unlimited usage makes a carpet of flying the best fl ight-granting magic item hands down, and its price refl ects that. If you cannot afford the largest size of carpet (which has room for a party of four and a luxurious 800-pound carrying capacity), buy the smaller 5-foot-square model instead. You can direct it verbally to ferry your allies one by one over any dungeon obstacle.
