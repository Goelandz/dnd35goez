The cause of a common, painful affliction among gigantic creatures, the pests called gut mites have been the salvation of more than one unlucky monster hunter. Each no bigger than a human’s thumbnail, these white, flylike parasites lay their eggs in the preferred food of large predators. The grubs quickly hatch within a creature’s stomach and feast on the liquefied food within—and, when that food runs out, the tender flesh of its host’s gut. One or two make their presence known within a host by merely a dull aching, but a swarm of gut mites can leave even the mightiest beast coiled in pain.

Harvested from the entrails of gigantic monsters, small swarms of these creatures are bottled and sold to those likely to encounter ravenus beasts. A typical bottle contains some adult gut mites and a mass of squirming grubs in a nutrient goo. It is a blessing to any character who has been swallowed whole.If you open a flask of gut mites while you are within a monster’s gizzard or stomach and pour out its ravenous contents, the grubs burrow into the tissue. The monster immediately vomits up the contents of its stomach, including any swallowed creatures, and cannot use its swallow whole ability for 1d4 minutes.

A successful DC 20 Fortitude save negates this effect, and instead causes the swallowing creature to be sickened for 1d4 minutes. Creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are not affected by gut mites.

A flask of gut mites can be used only once. The adults die within a day or two, while the grubs can survive for a week before their nutrient medium is depleted.
