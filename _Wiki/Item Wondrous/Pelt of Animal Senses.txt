This pelt, worn like a cloak, is made from large predator: a wolf, bear, or great cat. When worn, it grants low-light vision, scent, and a +2 circumstance bonus on Listen checks. Animals react poorly to the wearer while it is worn; herbivores in general become nervous and try to flee, while carnivores generally become aggressive.
