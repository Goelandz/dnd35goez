Lantern of Revealing (30,000 gp)

A constant invisibility purge (PH 245) within 25 feet is well worth the energy spent keeping this lantern fi lled with oil. Make sure it remains lit and that all party members stay within its radius as often as possible, especially when resting in a hostile dungeon.
