These draughts are thick liquids, similar to potions, that bestow magical effects on a creature drinking them. The magical effects duplicate the metabreath spells described in the previous section, but the drinker must supply the breath component for the effect to take place. Drinking a draught is a standard action, and activates the magic of the draught for just over 1 round. After drinking, the drinker must use its breath weapon before the end of the next round. This use of the drinker’s breath weapon is enhanced as if the drinker had cast the appropriate metabreath spell on itself. 

Draughts of metabreath magic come in a number of different varieties, whose caster level and market price are listed on the table below.
