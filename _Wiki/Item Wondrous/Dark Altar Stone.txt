This piece of black granite, if used as an altar or part of an altar, can be commanded to absorb the soul of a victim sacrificed upon that altar. The soul is stored as if in a gem as a part of a trap the soul spell. It can be called forth and used in the various ways described in the Souls as Power section of Chapter 2. A dark altar stone can store only one soul at a time.
