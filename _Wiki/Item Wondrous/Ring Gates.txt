Ring Gates (40,000 gp)

Dungeoneers should stick together as much as possible, but sometimes, a party simply must split into two groups that head in different directions. For example, a puzzle might require the simultaneous operation of two mechanisms that are located far apart. This pair of iron rings makes it easy to divide a party. Objects that are pushed only partially through the gates do not count toward the rings’ daily weight limit, so you can pop your head through for a quick conference with the other team as needed. Notes, maps, scrolls, and other light items can be sent through without worry. If one team is attacked, a spellcaster in the other group can send a spell through the ring gates to help her companions. And if you need to fi ddle with a mechanism that is located in a tight spot, let the wizard’s familiar carry one ring into the confi ned area, and stick your face and hands through the other ring
