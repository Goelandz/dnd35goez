Many ship captains keep a pearly okimono of the sea dragon in their cabins, although smaller vessels have one mounted on their bows for decoration. It is a mark of prestige to possess one, since these items greatly benefit warships, exploratory vessels, and fishers alike. 

Description: This ornate lung wang dragon scale is 12 inches in diameter and inlaid with mother-of-pearl, coral, and white pearls depicting an ocean scene. 

Activation: An okimono functions continuously as long as it is affixed to a water vessel. When first grasped, it telepathically instructs the owner (simultaneously in the Spirit Tongue and Draconic) on the effects of the item and how to activate it. 

Effect: When carried aboard a waterborne vessel, a pearly okimono of the sea dragon grants a +5 bonus on any Profession (sailor) checks made to control the ship by someone on the vessel. It also increases the vessel's hardness by 5 and halves any chance that the ship will capsize in rough water.
