This bronze medallion allows you to exchange one prepared spell for another.

Description: An amulet of spell conversion is a bronze octagon, roughly 2 inches on a side, dangling from either a leather thong or a bronze chain. Each of the eight sides is adorned with mystic runes; these meet in the middle, crossing and overlapping to form abstract patterns.

The amulet grows faintly warm to the touch when used, and the runes seem to waver as if viewed through shallow water or a heat mirage.

Prerequisite: An amulet of spell conversion functions only for arcane casters who prepare their spells in advance from a spellbook, such as wizards.

Activation: Activating the amulet requires a fullround action. It functions once per day.

Effect: An amulet of spell conversion allows you to lose one spell you have prepared for the day and replace it with another spell of equal or lower level. The new spell must be one that is already scribed in your spellbook. You can now cast that spell as though you had prepared it normally.
