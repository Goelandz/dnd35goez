Banned in almost every civilized society, this 1-foot-long statue of a locust is capable of incredible destruction to crops and agricultural areas. It is carved from a single piece of brilliant jade and has two large rubies for eyes. 

On command, the insatiable locust can animate. It then goes on an eating rampage, devouring up to ten tons of grain, crops, and fruits per day for up to seven days, over a diameter of fifty miles. It never attacks people or livestock and attempts to fly away when confronted with violence. The locust first eats planted crops, such as corn, wheat, and rye, followed by fruit and finally wild vegetation. The locust attacks and consumes plant creatures, but only after all other vegetation has been destroyed first. 

Once the locust has eaten for seven days (or there is no more food), it unerringly returns to its owner and reverts to its statue form. It cannot be reactivated again for another full seven days. The eaten crops are butterly destroyed.
