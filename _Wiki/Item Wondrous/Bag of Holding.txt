Bag of Holding (2,500 gp or more)

There is nothing more frustrating than trouncing a monster and not having enough carrying capacity to take its loot. A bag of holding can solve that problem, but if you bring this item into the dungeon empty, you are wasting half its potential. Instead, fi ll it with expendable items that you will use on the trip down through the dungeon, such as food, waterskins, potions, alchemical items, and so on. Then, after you defeat the dungeon’s overlord in a final, epic confrontation, the mostly empty bag will be ready to hold his treasure. (In a pinch, a bag of holding is also a good way to transport a friend’s armored corpse back to town to be resurrected—especially if he happens to be the party cleric.)
