Sometimes this symbol depicts a cornucopia emblazoned on a green background, but more often than not, it is an actual miniature cornucopia filled with carved wooden fruit. 

When used to cast law domain spells, spells that have the good descriptor, or spells that create food or water (such as create food and water or heroes' feast), a cornucopia of Yondalla increases your effective caster level by 1.
