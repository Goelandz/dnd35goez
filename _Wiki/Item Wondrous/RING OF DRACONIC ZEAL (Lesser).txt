A dragon can lash out at more than one enemy with its claws, teeth, wings, and tail. A lesser ring of draconic zeal grants its wearer a similar ability to attack multiple foes. 

Description: A lesser ring of draconic zeal is made of ivory carved to resemble hundreds of interlocking dragon scales. When the ring's power is activated, it emits a roar like that of a fearsome dragon. 

Activation: Once per day, the wearer can invoke the power of the ring (a swift action). 

Effect: Immediately after activating the ring, the wearer can make one melee attack using his highest base attack bonus against each of three different enemies within reach (a full-round action). 

This effect applies only during the round in which the ring is activated. If the wearer activates the ring but can't take a full-round action during that round, the effect is wasted.
