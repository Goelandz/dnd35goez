A sweetly flavored tincture distilled from many of the same fungi and roots used in making the drow’s infamous sleeping poison, this venom is a standby of poisoners who don’t want to harm their victims. Goodbye kiss is a favorite of lotharios, swindlers, and others who want to avoid being followed. It can either be added to food (ingested) or used to coat a small needle (injury); the save DC is the same regardless of the method of application.

A subject who fails either the initial or the secondary save becomes exhausted for 1 hour. Failing both saves renders the subject unconscious for 1 hour instead.
