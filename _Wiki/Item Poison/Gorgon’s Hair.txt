This versatile contact poison is named for a clever murderer who would coat her long hair in this concoction before seducing her victims. Clear and a little greasy, this toxin makes surfaces it is applied to look slightly wet, shiny, or cosmetically accented. It is unusual in that it does not affect those who already have it in their system. Thus, many who use gorgon’s hair ingest a dose—a mildly unpleasant act—before coating themselves with the poison. Those who fear being attacked by gorgon’s hair might also protect themselves by consuming the poison.

Typically, a wouldbe poisoner mixes a dose of gorgon’s hair with a liquid and drinks the concoction. After ingesting the toxin, that creature is immune to its effect for 24 hours.

An immune creature can safely apply a dose of gorgon’s hair to a hand or appendage to envenom an unarmed strike or natural attack.Only the first successful attack is affected; all attacks made afterward, even in the same round, do not deliver the poison.
