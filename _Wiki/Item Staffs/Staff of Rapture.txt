This ash staff bears a few holy etchings but otherwise looks unremarkable. However, in the hands of a cleric, the staff sheds golden light as brightly as a torch. The staff of rapture can be used as a +1 quarterstaff, but it deals only nonlethal damage. Against evil creatures, it has a critical threat range of 17–20.

The staff allows use of the following spells:
• Atonement (2 charges)
• Divination (1 charges)
• Elation (1 charge)
• Sword of conscience (2 charges)
• Vision of heaven (1 charge)
