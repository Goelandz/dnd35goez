Designed for no other purpose than to defeat spellcasters, a magebane staff is a prized weapon of casters who expect to battle their own kind.

Description: A magebane staff is made of heavy wood, banded at the top and bottom with rune-etched iron. Each staff of this kind functions as a masterwork quarterstaff, and many are enchanted with additional weapon-based abilities.

When activated, the staff emits a palpable aura of hostility that only spellcasters can feel. This has no mechanical
effect, but it does make casters—particularly arcane casters—uncomfortable.

Activation: A magebane staff is a spell trigger item, requiring a standard action to activate.

• arcane turmoil (page 96), 1 charge
