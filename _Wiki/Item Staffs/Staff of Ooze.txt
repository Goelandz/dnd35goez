Casters who prefer indirect methods of combat and can produce a variety of slimelike effects and impediments favor the staff of ooze.

Description: A staff of ooze is constructed of a heavy wood that glistens as though wet or slimy to the touch.

Physical contact reveals the wood to be perfectly dry, however.

 When the staff is in use, its head undulates slowly, as though made of a viscous substance slowly rolling downhill, but it always resumes its original appearance.

Activation: A staff of ooze is a spell trigger item, requiring a standard action to activate.

Effect: A staff of ooze allows the wielder to produce the following spell effects:
• grease, 1 charge
• incendiary slime (page 108), 1 charge
• resinous tar (page 115), 1 charge
• caustic mire (page 98), 2 charges
