First seen long ago in the hands of humans and drow in the service of powerful demons and devils, these staffs are made of ebony or polished bone, often topped with a metal claw at one or both ends. When held by any good creature, a staff of fi endish darkness bestows one negative level that remains as long as the staff is carried. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the staff is held. A staff of fi endish darkness allows the use of the following spells:
• Darkness (1 charge)
• Summon monster IX (nightmare only) (2 charges)
• Dispel magic (2 charges)
• Animate dead (2 charges)
