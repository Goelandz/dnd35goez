A dreamstaff grants its wielder power over sleep and dreams.

Description: A dreamstaff is carved of light ash wood and possesses strange marbling patterns that run up and down the length. It is unusually slender and topped with a crystal finial.

The mottling and marbling seem to shift and writhe when the staff is activated, and the crystal fills with smoky, abstract images that are strangely familiar to the viewer.

Activation: A dreamstaff is a spell trigger item, requiring a standard action to activate.

Effect: A dreamstaff allows the wielder to produce the following spell effects:
• deep slumber 1 charge
• endless slumber (page 103), 2 charges
• dream, 3 charges
• nightmare, 3 charges
