Well loved by casters who expect to face rivals with similar abilities, a ring of enduring arcana renders your spells more resistant to dispelling.

Description: This ring is actually a webwork lattice of gold and mithral that takes up most of the length of the finger. (It is jointed in the middle to allow full movement.) The lattice seems to shift and flow any time the wearer casts a spell.

Activation: A ring of enduring arcana remains active constantly, as long as it is worn. When first donned, however, it requires 24 hours to acclimate to the wearer before it functions.

Effect: You are considered four levels higher than your actual caster level whenever another character attempts to dispel or counter one of your spells.

Aura/Caster Level: Moderate abjuration. CL 9th.
Construction: Forge Ring, dispel magic, 3,000 gp, 240 XP, 6 days.
Price: 6,000 gp.
