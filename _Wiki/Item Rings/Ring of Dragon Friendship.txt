This ring is carved to look like a dragon coiled around the wearer’s finger. The wearer gains a +5 enhancement bonus on Diplomacy checks made to influence the attitude of dragons. No dragon will voluntarily attack or otherwise attempt to harm the wearer.

Once per month, the wearer can use a suggestion effect on a dragon (heightened to 9th level; Will DC 23 negates).

If the wearer attacks a dragon in any way (including by the use of the ring’s suggestion power), this ring loses its powers for 24 hours.

(The suggestion effect can continue after the ring stops working.)
