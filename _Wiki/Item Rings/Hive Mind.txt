These rings are formed of a brownishred substance like horn or chitin, resembling the carapace of a formian. A single ring of hive mind provides no benefit to its wearer unless another character with another ring of the same kind is within 1 mile. All characters wearing rings of hive mind within 1 mile of one another can communicate telepathically among themselves, and their minds mesh in a close joining. If one such character is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one character in a group is not flat-footed, none of them are. No such character in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are.
