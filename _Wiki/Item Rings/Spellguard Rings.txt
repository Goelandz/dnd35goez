This pair of rings allows a spellcaster to designate an ally temporarily immune to his magic.

Description: Both of a pair of spellguard rings are ornate bands; one is forged of gold, the other of bronze. Draconic writing around the interior of both rings translates roughly as “Let no friend of mine ever feel the sting of my magic.”

Activation: A spellcaster activates the power of spellguard rings as a free action in conjunction with casting a spell. They function up to three times per day. 

Effect: In order for them to function, both spellguard rings must be worn—the gold ring by a spellcaster, the bronze one by anyone else. When the rings are activated, the wearer of the bronze ring becomes immune to any spell cast by the wearer of the gold ring, as long as that spell is cast within 1 round.

The rings can be useful for pulling off certain tactical maneuvers, such as letting the spellcaster lob a fireball into the midst of a horde of orcs, even though his paladin companion stands right in the center of them.

The construction costs and price below are for a pair of matched rings. If one ring of a pair is lost or destroyed, the other becomes useless.
