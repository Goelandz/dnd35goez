Tiny organic thorns fall from the sky. Those caught in this brief rainfall take 1d2 points of damage each round, unless they can get under some sort of shelter. The nettles that strike soil burrow into the ground and sprout thick, choking weeds that kill whole crops in a few minutes. A plague of nettles is violent enough to tear up and choke a forest in just a day. One week after the nettles fall, the area is thick with animate, dangerous plants such as assassin vines, tendriculoses, and shambling mounds. 

This malevolent rainfall spreads across 3d6 square miles and lasts for 3d6 rounds.
