Made from fine wood by elven hands, this +2 shortbow blends music with every shot to deadly effect. As a move-equivalent action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, the wielder may give up one daily use of bardic music to add his Charisma bonus to attack and damage rolls on the next single attack made with the bow of songs.
