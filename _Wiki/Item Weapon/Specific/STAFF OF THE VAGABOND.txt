This battered, weatherbeaten stick looks far too flimsy and brittle to be usable as a quarterstaff—or even as a walking stick. 

This masterwork/masterwork quarterstaff becomes a +1/+1 quarterstaff as long as you are carrying no other weapons. (Natural weapons or unarmed attacks don't count, but weapons you carry in a bag of holding or other container do. ) 

The staff of the vagabond is part of a set known collectively as the garb of the vagabond, which also includes 
the cloak of the vagabond, the robe of the vagabond, and the sandals of the vagabond. When you wield the staff of the vagabond while wearing any two of the other items, each end gains the merciful property (DMG 225). When you wield it while wearing all three of the other items, each end also gains the ki focus property (DMG 225) 

Cost to Create: 1, 500 gp (plus 600 gp for masterwork/masterwork quarterstaff), 120 XP, 3 days. 
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, cure light wounds, monk.
