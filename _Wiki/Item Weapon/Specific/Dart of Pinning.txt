Although it looks more like a large needle than an instrument of war, this +2 dart has the deadly ability to hold a foe motionless. Targets struck by a dart of pinning must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 13) or be paralyzed as though by carrion crawler brain juice (see Poison in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’S Guide). The effect lasts for 7 rounds.
