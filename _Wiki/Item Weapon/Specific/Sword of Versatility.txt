As a move-equivalent action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, the wielder can transform this +2/+2 two-bladed sword into two +1 longswords. Recombining the swords is also a move-equivalent action. Both halves of the sword of versatility function exactly like normal +1 longswords when separated from each other.
