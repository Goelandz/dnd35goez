These roughly wrought iron gauntlets remain a dull, dark gray regardless of how often they are polished. Despite their crude appearance, ghost handsare a surprisingly light pair of +1 ghost touch gauntlets. While wearing ghost hands, the wielder is immune to the magic jarspell and a ghost’s malevolence ability. Ghost hands provide a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls but attacks with them are still considered unarmed for purposes of provoking attacks of opportunity.
