Also called the coward’s sword, this +3 longsword grants its wielder a better chance to avoid mishaps of all kinds. Whenever the wielder takes the total defense action while holding the sword of avoidance, he gains a +4 luck bonus to AC and on all saving throws. This bonus lasts until the beginning of the wielder’s next turn.
