A vanishing blade is a +3 rapier that allows its wielder to travel short distances instantaneously. Once per day, after a successful melee attack, the wielder of the vanishing blade may transfer himself instantaneously to any spot within 800 feet. This effect functions exactly as the dimension door spell from a 10th-level caster.
