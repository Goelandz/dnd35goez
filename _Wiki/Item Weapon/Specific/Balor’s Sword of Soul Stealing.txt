The most fearsome weapon carried by the balors, this Large +3 vorpal bastard sword appears as a crackling black-andpurple flame. A precious black sapphire is set in the weapon’s pommel. When it severs the head of a living creature, the sword draws forth the soul of the victim and imprisons it in the black sapphire, as the soul bind spell. The victim receives a Will save (DC 23) to avoid the soul bind effect. If the weapon severs the head of a creature with more than 30 Hit Dice, the sapphire shatters without imprisoning the soul, and it must be replaced. The sapphire can contain only one soul at a time, but balors are rumored to know mystic rituals that can draw the soul out of the gem, allowing them to use it for various vile purposes.

This item is significantly more expensive than the standard-issue balor weapon. A balor equipped with a sword of soul stealing typically has only its sword and its whip, and no additional treasure.
