This +2 greataxe gives its wielder the ability to make tremendous, whirling attacks. Once per day, the wielder of a whirling axe can make an attack that has a chance of striking all opponents within 5 feet. This functions like the Whirlwind Attack feat and requires a full action. Instead of making his regular attacks, the wielder instead makes one melee attack at his full base attack bonus against each adjacent opponent.
