This +1 trident allows its wielder to move through water with ease. While holding a trident of the depths, the wielder can swim at a speed of 30 feet. When submerged in water of any kind, the trident gains an additional +1 bonus on attack and damage. When submerged in ocean water, this bonus increases to +2; the bonus for being underwater stacks with the trident’s enhancement bonus.
