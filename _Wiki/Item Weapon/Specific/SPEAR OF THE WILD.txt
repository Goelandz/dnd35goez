This spear has a head of gleaming iron and a shaft of dark, heavy wood. Ivy vines carved into the shaft provide a textured grip. 

In the hands of most wielders, this weapon is a simple +1 spear that also grants its wielder a +2 competence bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks. 

If you are a druid, a ranger, or a cleric with the Animal domain, the spear of the wild automatically casts baleful polymorph on any creature upon which it scores a critical hit. A successful Fortitude save (DC 15 + your Wis modifier) negates this effect. This effect functions three times per day. 

Cost to Create: 12, 000 gp (plus 302 gp for masterwork spear), 960 XP, 24 days. 
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, baleful polymorph, Knowledge (nature) 10 ranks, Survival 10 ranks.
