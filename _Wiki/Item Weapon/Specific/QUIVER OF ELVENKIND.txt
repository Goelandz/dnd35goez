Made of soft brown leather, this quiver has been expertly stitched with golden strands. A tiny image of an eye is etched into its strap. 

A quiver of elvenkind holds up to 50 arrows. Any nonmagical arrow drawn forth from the quiver functions as a +1 arrow (as long as it has been held in the quiver for at least the previous hour). This magic fades after 1 round. 

If you are an elf or a worshiper of Corellon Larethian, however, any nonmagical arrow drawn from the quiver functions instead as a +1 orc bane arrow, and on a critical hit permanently blinds any living target (Fortitude DC 14 negates). 

If you are an elf using this quiver in conjunction with a bow of elvenkind (page 137), you gain additional benefits as noted in the description of that item. 

Cost to Create: 4, 000 gp, 320 XP, 8 days.
