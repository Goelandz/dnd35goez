The magical properties of this +2 longspear make it suited for use on foot or on horseback. When used by a character on foot, the equestrian’s spear functions exactly like a longspear. When used by a mounted character proficient with the heavy lance, the equestrian’s spear is treated in all respects as a heavy lance. Mounted characters not proficient in the heavy lance may still use the weapon as a longspear.
