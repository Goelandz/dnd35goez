This red and gold +1 returning dart has a tail made of phoenix feathers. Throwing the dart requires a sacrifice of 1d4 points of temporary Strength damage. However, any creature struck by the dart, regardless of whether it takes damage, must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be instantly slain and reduced to a small pile of ashes. If the save succeeds, the creature takes 13d6 points of fire damage instead. If a creature makes its saving throw but is slain by the damage, it is reduced to a pile of ashes as well.

Any creature reduced to ashes by the dart reforms after 2d6 rounds, appearing in the exact spot where it died and in whatever state it was before being incinerated. Although damage from the actual dart remains, all fire damage is instantly restored.

Creatures immune to fire take no fire damage and are not incinerated. Fire resistance applies to damage dealt if a creature makes its Fortitude save.
