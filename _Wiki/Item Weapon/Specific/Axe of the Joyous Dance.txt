This +3 dancing handaxe always looks well-polished and new, and its blade is covered with light etchings of satyrs dancing. Once per day while dancing, the axe can, at the mental command of its owner, produce Tasha’s hideous laughter (as the spell from a 4th-level caster) instead of making a normal attack. Creatures affected can make a Will save (DC 19) to resist the axe’s effects.

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, animate objects, Tasha’s hideous laughter;
Market Price: 107,906 gp; Cost to Create: 54,106 gp + 4,304 XP
