A +2 longsword, the sword of sanctuary offers its wielder temporary protection when in battle. Once per day, the sword of sanctuary can create a sanctuary effect centered on the sword (as the spell heightened to 3rd level by a 5th-level caster). While protected by the sword’s sanctuary, any opponent attempting to attack the wielder must succeed on a Will save (DC 14) to do so. In addition, the sword can cast an obscuring mist spell once per day (heightened to 3rd level by a 5th-level caster). If the wielder drops or otherwise loses possession of the sword of sanctuary, these effects cease to function.
