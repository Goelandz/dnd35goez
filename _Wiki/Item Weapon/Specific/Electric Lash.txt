The blue-tinged leather of this +2 shock whip seems to spark with small motes of electric energy. Three times per day, the wielder of the electric lash may make an arcing strike. This attack deals an additional +2d6 points of electricity damage (3d6 total) to the target if the attack is successful. Furthermore, the electric jolt arcs to any one creature within 5 feet of the target. That target takes half as much electricity damage as the first target did. If more than one creature is within 5 feet of the target, roll randomly to see which one is affected by the arc of electricity. Arcing strike damage is not multiplied by critical hits.
