The wielder of this +4/+3 two-bladed sword can make an additional raking attack if she manages to get inside her opponent’s defenses. Anytime the wielder hits the same target with the first attack made with her primary hand and the first offhand attack during the same round, the wielder may make an extra attack with the raking blade. This extra attack is at –5 on the wielder’s best attack bonus.
