Although it is made from obsidian, the magical properties of this +2 wounding shuriken make it as strong as steel. Once per day, the wielder can make a blinding strike with shadow’s hand. To make a blinding strike, the wielder makes a normal ranged attack with the weapon. If the attack is successful, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be blinded as the blindness/deafness spell from a 10th-level caster.
