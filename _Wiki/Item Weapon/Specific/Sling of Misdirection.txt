This +1 bane (construct) sling temporarily robs constructs of their ability to follow their instructions. Any construct hit by a bullet or stone from a sling of misdirection must succeed on a Will save (DC 12) or suffer the effects of the random action spell. This ability affects even creatures otherwise immune to mind-influencing magic.
