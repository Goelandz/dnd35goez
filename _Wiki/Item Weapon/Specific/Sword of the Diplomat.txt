The gold hilt of this +3 defending short sword is elaborately carved to resemble the folded wings of a bird. The possessor of this ornate blade is shielded by a constant aura of magical force. This force effect functions exactly like a permanent version of the mage armor spell, providing a +4 armor bonus to the possessor’s AC. Like the mage armor spell, this bonus applies to incorporeal attacks.
