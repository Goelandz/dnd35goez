This shaft of this light +1 bane (animal) shortspear is eternally fresh, appearing to be newly cut wood. The spear is tipped with a bone point rather than metal, but its magic ensures that it is no less effective than a typical spear. When outdoors, the spear of the hunt grants its wielder the Track feat, if the wielder does not already have it. The spear grants no bonus on Wilderness Lore or Search checks.
