Rangers, scouts, spies, and many elves covet these arrows. By taking a full-round action to concentrate, the user can see what is happening in the vicinity of the arrow as if using the clairvoyance spell. Five minutes after being fired against a target, the arrow crumbles to dust. Otherwise, it is in all ways a +1 arrow.
