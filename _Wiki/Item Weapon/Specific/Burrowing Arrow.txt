This +1 arrow sticks into its target on a successful hit and embeds itself in the wound. A burrowing arrow must be pulled out before natural healing can occur, and this removal deals a further 1d8 points of damage. If the target receives magical healing, the burrowing arrow immediately deals 1d8 points of damage as the magic forces it out of the wound.
