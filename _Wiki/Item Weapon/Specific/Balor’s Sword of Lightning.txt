A variation on the traditional balor’s blade is this Large +1 brilliant energy shock bastard sword. This weapon can detect law as cast by a 12th-level sorcerer, but with a range of 30 feet. These weapons resemble bolts of lightning. Because the market price of this item is the same as for the balor’s sword of flame, it can be substituted for that weapon with no adjustment to the balor’s treasure.
