This +2 sling allows the wielder to bounce attacks off nearby surfaces and catch opponents off guard. Any time the wielder makes an attack against a target within 5 feet of a wall, that target is denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class. This ability does not function against a foe of Intelligence 5 or greater who has experienced the ricochet sling effect before.
