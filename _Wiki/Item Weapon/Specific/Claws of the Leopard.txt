This pair of +2 spiked gauntlets have been shaped to look like the paws of an oversized cat. In addition to their enhancement bonus, they provide several felinelike advantages. While wearing the claws of the leopard, the wielder gains low-light vision and a +10 enhancement bonus on Climb checks. During the first round of combat, the wielder can leap on a foe, allowing her to make a full attack with the claws of the leopard even if she has already taken a move action. This ability functions exactly like the leopard’s pounce ability (see Appendix 1: Animals of the Monster Manual).
