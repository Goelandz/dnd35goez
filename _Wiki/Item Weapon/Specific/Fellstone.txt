This +3 heavy pick is made entirely from stone, and its magical properties give its wielder great power over stone. Earth creatures struck with fellstone must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 13) or be dazed until the beginning of the wielder’s next action. Whenever both the wielder and her opponent are touching the ground, fellstone grants a +1 bonus on attacks and damage. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the wielder takes a –4 penalty on attacks and damage. Furthermore, as long as the wielder is touching the ground, she can start a bull rush without provoking an attack of opportunity. The combat modifiers given above for melee attacks also apply to the wielder’s opposed Strength check when attempting a bull rush.
