This Large +2 heavy crossbow is covered with dwarven runes, and the intricate stock has been carved to resemble the head of a hammer. Because of its increased size, the dwarven mauler deals 1d12 points of damage on a successful hit. This increase in size does not affect the time it takes to load the crossbow.
