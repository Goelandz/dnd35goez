Each side of this +4 defending halberd is etched with the faint image of a disembodied eye hovering over an unadorned shield. The vigilant halberd is a powerful weapon of good. When a paladin uses her smite evil ability and successfully attacks with a vigilant halberd, the smite deals 2 points of damage per level instead of 1 point of damage per level.
