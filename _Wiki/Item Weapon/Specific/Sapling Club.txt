This irregular +1 club always has a leaf or three adorning it, and the wood retains the resiliency of a freshly cut branch. By spending a fullround action holding the sapling club to the ground, the wielder can cause the club to transform into a treant. The treant acts as a summoned creature, attacking the nearest foe unless the wielder commands otherwise. A sapling club may spend up to 12 rounds as a treant each day, although the rounds need not be consecutive. At any time, the wielder of the club can utter a command word to transform the sapling club back to its original form. If killed while in treant form, the sapling club is destroyed.
