This +3 club can cause most metal weapons to instantly rust away. In order to activate the rusting ability, the wielder of a weaponeater must attack his opponent’s weapon. Unless the wielder has the Sunder feat, this provokes an attack of opportunity from the target. If the wielder succeeds in striking a metal weapon in this manner, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 16) or the struck weapon instantly crumbles to dust. Magic weapons struck in this manner provide a bonus equivalent to their enhancement bonus on their wielder’s saving throw. After 50 uses of the rusting ability, a weaponeater crumbles to dust itself.
