Made entirely from magically augmented stone, this +2 shortspear weighs 10 pounds. Because of its weight and unwieldy nature, the stone spear has a range increment of only 10 feet. A stone spear deals double damage against any creatures with the Air subtype on a successful hit. If a wielder standing on the ground uses a ready action to set the stone spear against a charge, it deals triple rather than double damage.
