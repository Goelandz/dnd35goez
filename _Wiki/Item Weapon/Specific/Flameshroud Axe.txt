Made from an incredibly hard red metal (hardness 15, 30 hp), this +3 flaming battleaxe can wrap its wielder in a protective shield of fire. Once per day, the flameshroud axe can produce an effect similar to the fire shield spell (chill version) from an 11th-level sorcerer. Activating the axe’s fire shield ability is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity.
