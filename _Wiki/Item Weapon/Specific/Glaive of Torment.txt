This +1 wounding glaive gains additional power in the hands of a barbazu or any other creature with a natural wounding ability. Whenever such a creature wields the weapon, those struck by it are racked with pain, taking a –4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks, for 3 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC 16) lessens the penalty to –2.
