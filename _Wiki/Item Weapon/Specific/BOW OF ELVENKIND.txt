Gleaming white wood and horn have been lovingly shaped into a massive, recurved longbow. The string shimmers like silver, and the bow hums when drawn, as if the wood had been tuned for musical purposes. 

This +1 composite longbow (+0 Str bonus) automatically adjusts its pull to match the Strength of any elf who wields it. In the hands of a cleric of Corellon Larethian, a bow of elvenkind gains the seeking weapon property (DMG 225), and any critical hit with an arrow fired from the bow renders the target shaken for 5 rounds (a mind-affecting fear effect; Will DC 14 negates). 

Furthermore, any elf or cleric of Corellon Larethian who uses the bow with arrows from the quiver of elvenkind (page 144) gains the benefit of the Far Shot feat. 

Cost to Create: 7, 000 gp (plus 700 gp for masterwork composite longbow), 560 XP, 14 days. 
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, doom, true seeing, doom, elf.
