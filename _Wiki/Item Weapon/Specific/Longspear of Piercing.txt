Three times per day, the wielder of this +3 longspear may ignore the natural armor (including any enhancement bonuses) of a target he attacks with the weapon. The wielder decides to use this ability as a free action before the attack roll is made. Armor bonuses and all other bonuses to AC still apply normally.
