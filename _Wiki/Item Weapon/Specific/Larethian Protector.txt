This +2 longbow is greatly prized by clerics of the elven god Corellon Larethian. The wielder of the Larethian protector can take a standard action and expend a turn undead attempt to imbue the bow with divine power. The next arrow from the bow that hits an evil humanoid deals an additional 1d6 points of divine damage per point of the wielder’s Charisma bonus (minimum 1d6).
