Made from forge-blackened iron and darkwood, this +2 shadowstrike heavy flail has a powerful bond with the Plane of Shadow. In addition to its shadowstrike ability, the flail of shadows allows its wielder to cast dimension door with a command word (as the spell from an 11th-level caster, but the dimension door must originate and terminate in an area of shadow).
