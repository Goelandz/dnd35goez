Each of these projectiles carries a deadly load of alchemist’s fire in its hollow shaft. When it strikes a target, the arrow’s shaft shatters, releasing the alchemist’s fire directly onto the target. One round after impact, the alchemist’s fire ignites, dealing 1d4 points of damage. The target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the
flames before taking this damage. It takes a successful Reflex saving throw (DC 15) to extinguish the flames.
Rolling on the ground earns the target a +2 bonus on the save. Submerging (such as by leaping into a lake)
or magically extinguishing the flames automatically kills the flames
