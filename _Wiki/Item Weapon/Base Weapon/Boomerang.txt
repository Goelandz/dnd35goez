The boomerang is a curved throwing stick that returns to its thrower if it misses its target. To catch a returning boomerang, the thrower must make an attack roll (as if he were throwing the boomerang) and hit AC 10. Failure indicates the boomerang lands in a randomly determined square adjacent to the thrower (if the thrower is proficient) or 1d4 squares away in a random direction (if not profi cient).
