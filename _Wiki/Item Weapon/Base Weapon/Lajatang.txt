The lajatang is a staff with a crescent-shaped blade at each end. A lajatang is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fi ghting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons: a one-handed weapon and a light weapon (see page 160 of the Player’s Handbook).

 A monk who is profi cient with the lajatang can treat it as a special monk weapon, as described in the monk class description (page 40 of the Player’s Handbook). Each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of the fl urry of blows ability, similar to how the quarterstaff works.
