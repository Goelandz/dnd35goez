This rapierlike weapon is the size of a longsword, but much lighter. Dexterous elf fighters and rogues favor it. Its thin, fl exible blade slips easily into the seams of armor, or between the ribs of an enemy. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifi er instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls 
with an elven thinblade.
