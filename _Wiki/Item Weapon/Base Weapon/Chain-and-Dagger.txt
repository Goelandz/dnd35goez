When wielding the chain-anddagger, you gain a +2 bonus on your opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed yourself, if you fail to disarm your foe). You can also use this
weapon to make trip attacks, gaining a +2 bonus on your trip attempt. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can opt to drop the chain-anddagger instead of being tripped.
