City guards and others who prefer to capture their opponents unharmed use the mancatcher. A wielder who hits a target of its size or one size category smaller than it with a mancatcher can immediately attempt to grapple (as a free action) without provoking an attack of opportunity. Any grapple check you make using a mancatcher includes the mancatcher’s enhancement bonus (if any) and any other bonuses you might have on attack rolls with the weapon (such as from the Weapon Focus feat). If you grapple a target with a mancatcher, you are considered grappling, but unless your target can reach you, he can’t attempt to attack you, damage you, or pin you. You can escape the grapple automatically by releasing the target as a standard action.

 In addition to the normal options available to a grappler, the wielder of a mancatcher can attempt to force his target to the ground (the equivalent of a trip attack, though no attack roll is necessary). The mancatcher is a reach weapon and cannot be used against adjacent opponents.
