This double-stringed longbow can be used as a normal longbow by anyone proficient in that weapon. Characters with Exotic Weapon Proficiency (elven double bow) can use the bow to fire two arrows at once. Nocking an arrow on the second string requires a move-equivalent action. Once the wielder has taken an action to load the second string, his next attack is a double shot that launches both arrows simultaneously at the same target. The wielder makes one attack roll at a –2 penalty to determine whether or not both arrows strike the target. If the attack is successful, both arrows deal normal damage. If the attack is a critical hit, only one arrow deals extra damage, and extra sneak attack damage is applied only once
