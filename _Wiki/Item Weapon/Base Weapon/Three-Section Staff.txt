Originally a farm implement for threshing grain, this weapon is composed of three sections of wood of equal length, joined at the ends by chain, leather, or rope.

A monk using a three-section staff (for which she must take an Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat) fights with her unarmed base attack bonus and her more favorable number of attacks per round, along with other applicable attack modifiers. The three-section staff requires two hands to use.
