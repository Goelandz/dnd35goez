The duom is a longspear with a standard spearhead, as well as two blades curved so that they point backward along the shaft. The weapon has reach, allowing you to strike opponents 10 feet away with it. Those proficient with the duom can also attack adjacent foes with the reversed heads using a practiced “reverse thrust.” Apply a –2 penalty on the attack roll if you use the duom to attack a second, adjacent opponent in the same round you attacked the first opponent.
