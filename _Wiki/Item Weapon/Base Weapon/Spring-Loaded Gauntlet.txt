This gauntlet possesses a broad ridge of metal that extends along the bottom of the forearm to the edge of the wrist articulation, where a circular orifice is visible. This ridge of metal hides a spring-loaded mechanism that can expel a bolt with great force, akin to a miniscule crossbow. You load the gauntlet by inserting a bolt in the hole and pulling back a hidden lever. Loading the springloaded gauntlet is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity. You fire the spring-loaded gauntlet by sighting down your arm, then flip your hand back so that your palm faces your opponent—this motion fires the gauntlet. The cost and weight are for a single gauntlet. 

A character who attempts to fire two spring-loaded gauntlets at once incurs the standard penalty for two-weapon fighting. The Ambidexterity feat lets someone avoid the –4 off-hand penalty
