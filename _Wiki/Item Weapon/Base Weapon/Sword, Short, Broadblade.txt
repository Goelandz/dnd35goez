Broadblade short swords have a wider blade and crossguard than normal swords. This feature makes them more difficult to wield in combat, but the design allows skilled users to defend themselves better when fighting cautiously.

 If you are proficient with the broadblade short sword and you fi ght defensively or employ the total defense combat maneuver, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC for the rest of the round in addition to the normal AC bonus from the combat maneuver (+2 for fi ghting defensively or +4 for total defense). This bonus also applies if you are profi cient with the weapon, have the Combat Expertise feat, and shift at least 2 points of your attack bonus to AC for the round. Because of its benefit when fi ghting defensively, the broadblade short sword is a popular off-hand weapon. 

 Characters profi cient with the broadblade short sword can treat it as a short sword for the purpose of any of the following feats: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, and Weapon Specialization.
