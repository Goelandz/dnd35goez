Any creature using an improvised weapon—from a broken bottle to a barstool—in a fi ght is considered to be nonproficient with it and thus takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls made with it. An improvised weapon scores a threat (a possible critical hit) on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.
