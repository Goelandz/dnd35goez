This light, flexible spear intended for ranged attacks resembles a standard javelin except for the spiral grooves that run down its
length. You can loop a throwing string around the shaft (the other end is tied to your finger). The string imparts spin to the javelin upon release, improving the weapon’s accuracy, range, and penetrating power by permitting a harder cast. Looping a string around the javelin is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Tying a casting string around your finger is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, but the same string is reused for multiple javelins. The javelin can be
thrown without spinning it, in which case its damage, range, and threat range are those of a standard javelin. If used in melee, treat the spinning javelin as a standard javelin.
