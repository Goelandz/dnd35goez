Strapped to the forearm of its wearer, a sleeve blade lies hidden under a long-sleeved shirt or dress.

Making a quick downward flick with the wrist triggers the mechanism, extending the blade beyond the top of the wearer’s hand. Treat a sleeve blade as a dagger.

Hidden Blades

Scoundrels generally avoid fair fights. Many hide various weapons about their bodies to glean whatever advantage they can.

   A hidden blade is a springloaded blade attached to the inside of armor or boots or strapped to the scoundrel’s body. Activating a hidden blade requires a move action.

Hidden blades can be made masterwork or magic just as normal weapons can be. Attacking with a hidden blade imposes a –2 penalty on the attack roll.

Discovering a hidden blade before it has been activated requires a DC 15 Search check.
