Adding a short blade to the front of a hand crossbow allows you to defend yourself in melee combat without having to draw a different weapon.

The blade functions as a dagger.

Bayonets and Combination Blades 

Archers, crossbowmen, and others who rely on ranged weapons are at a distinct disadvantage when an enemy closes within melee range. In order to maximize survivability in such situations, many ranged specialists attach blades to their weapons.

These blades, called bayonets, give ranged weapons melee capability.

A bayonet does not interfere with the normal functioning of the weapon to which it is fixed, so it can remain attached indefinitely. Bayonets act in all ways like normal melee weapons, as noted in their descriptions, and can be made masterwork or magic (separately from any masterwork or magic property of the main weapon). Attaching or removing a bayonet requires a move action. Attacking with a bayonet imposes a –2 penalty on the attack roll.
