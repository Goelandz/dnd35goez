A stout shaft with a spiked, cylindrical head at each end, this is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two
weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons as if you are using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon (see Attacking with Two Weapons in Chapter 8 of the Player’s Handbook). A creature
wielding a double weapon in one hand can’t use it as a double weapon.
