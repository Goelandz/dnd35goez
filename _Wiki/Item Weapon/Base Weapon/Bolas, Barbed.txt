This weapon is similar to a normal set of bolas, except that its weighted balls are studded with hooked barbs and thus deal lethal (not nonlethal) damage. Because the barbed bolas can wrap around an enemy’s leg or other limb, you can use this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against an opponent. You can’t be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a set of barbed bolas.

 For purposes of weapon profi ciency and similar feats, barbed bolas are treated as if they were bolas. Thus, if you have Exotic Weapon Profi ciency (bolas), you are also proficient with barbed bolas
