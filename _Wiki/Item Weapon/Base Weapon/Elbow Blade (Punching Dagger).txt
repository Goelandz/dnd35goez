Hidden within bracers or the forearm piece of a suit of armor, elbow blades jut out backward and lie flat against the back of the bearer’s upper arm.

Activating an elbow blade usually requires a flick or twist of the wrist. Treat an elbow blade as a punching dagger.

Hidden Blades

Scoundrels generally avoid fair fights. Many hide various weapons about their bodies to glean whatever advantage they can.

   A hidden blade is a springloaded blade attached to the inside of armor or boots or strapped to the scoundrel’s body. Activating a hidden blade requires a move action.

Hidden blades can be made masterwork or magic just as normal weapons can be. Attacking with a hidden blade imposes a –2 penalty on the attack roll.

Discovering a hidden blade before it has been activated requires a DC 15 Search check.
