A heavy poleaxe has reach; you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe. Normally, you strike with the heavy poleaxe’s axe head, but the spike on the end is useful against charging opponents. If you use a ready action to set a heavy poleaxe against a charge, you deal double damage if you score a hit against a charging creature.
