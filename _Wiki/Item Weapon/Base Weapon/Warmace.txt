 Anyone wielding a warmace takes a –1 penalty to Armor Class because the weight of the weapon makes it diffi cult to recover quickly from swinging it. A warmace is too large to use in one hand without special training (the appropriate Exotic Weapon Profi ciency feat). A character can use a warmace two-handed as a martial weapon.
