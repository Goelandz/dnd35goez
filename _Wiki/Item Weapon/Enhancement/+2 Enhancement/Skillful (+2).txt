Highly prized by many arcane spellcasters, a skillful weapon can be wielded without penalty by a character not normally profi cient with it. In addition, the wielder’s base attack bonus improves to a minimum of 3/4 his level (as a cleric of the same character level) when he attacks with a skillful weapon, though he gains no such bonus with any other weapon, even if a skillful weapon is wielded at the same time.

 The skillful special ability can be added only to melee weapons.
