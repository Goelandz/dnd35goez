On a successful critical hit against an evil creature, this weapon discharges a radiant burst that deals +3d6  points of damage to the target and blinds it for 1 round. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save negates the blindness. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted confer the heavenly burst power upon their ammunition.

Every time this weapon discharges a radiant burst, the wielder takes 1d2 points of temporary Strength damage.
