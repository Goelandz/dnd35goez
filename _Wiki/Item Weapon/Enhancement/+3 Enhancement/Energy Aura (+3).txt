Regardless of the energy type selected, the energy does not harm the hands that hold the weapon. The weapon deals an additional +1d6 points of damage of the appropriate energy type on a successful hit. Changing the weapon’s energy aura is a free action available once per round. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this ability bestow the energy type upon their ammunition.
