This dark, glittering steel alloy holds an attraction to souls recently released from their bodies. Obviously, 
this has application for melee weapons. If a thinaun melee weapon is touching a creature when it dies, that creature’s soul is sucked into the weapon rather than passing on to its final reward. The soul remains in the thinaun weapon until the weapon is destroyed or another creature dies while touching the thinaun weapon (the new soul displaces the old one). 

Raise dead, resurrection, and similar spells won’t bring back a creature whose soul is trapped by a thinaun weapon unless the caster has the weapon in his possession. Because the soul is nearby, fewer material components are required for such spells: Reincarnation, raise dead, resurrection, and true resurrection require half as much of the relevant material component (unguents or diamonds) to cast if the soul is within a thinaun weapon.

 A thinaun weapon captures a soul from anyone killed while touching the weapon. This means that if the thinaun weapon’s wielder dies, her weapon captures her soul.

 Only melee weapons made primarily of metal can be crafted as thinaun weapons.
