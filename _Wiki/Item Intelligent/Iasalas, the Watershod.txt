Personality: Iasalas is imbued with the spirit of an elder water elemental and is adorned with graven symbols of the sea, including eels and anemones. A fierce weapon, it relishes the sound of evil’s brittle bones cracking under its mighty blows. It has little patience for those of different alignment and those who can’t wield it masterfully, and it chides a wielder who frequently misses his enemies in combat and criticizes underhanded or unseemly tactics. Once earned, however, Iasalas’s loyalty is unflinching and absolute.
