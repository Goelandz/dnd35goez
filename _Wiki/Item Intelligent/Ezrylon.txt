Personality: A half-celestial weaponsmith crafted Ezrylon for a halfling paladin of unshakable valor. During a raid on an evil temple, the halfling fell beneath the maul of a fiendish minotaur cleric, who later tasked a minion to destroy the paladin’s sword. Ezrylon persuaded the slow-witted underling to sell it instead, and gradually the blade found its way into the hands of an evil gnome assassin. Through this unlikely partnership, Ezrylon learned that evil often feeds on itself, and for several years, the assassin put Ezrylon’s demon bane power to good use. The assassin lost the blade in a gambling match with a shady merchant, who is currently seeking a buyer for the blade. Ezrylon isn’t quick to judge evildoers, but it swells with anger when it senses demons nearby.
