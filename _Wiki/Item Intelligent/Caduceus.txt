Personality: Legend has it that a faithful cleric of Pelor found this white ash staff with silver inlaid runes in a brook while on a pilgrimage. The cleric heard a babbling sound coming from the brook, walked out among its shoals, and drew the talking staff from its shallow depths. Caduceus (kah-DOO-shuss) has no memory of its origin, but it chats incessantly about the many great heroes it has helped over the years. The staff abhors bloodshed and violence, and it sometimes elects to not heal wounds it
feels are justified or deserved.
