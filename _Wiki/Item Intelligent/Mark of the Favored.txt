This ring of regeneration was created by Wee Jas as a gift to one of her loyal champions. In addition to its regenerative properties, the ring can cast cure light wounds on its wearer once per day, and it grants its wearer uncanny dodge as a 5th-level barbarian. In addition, the wearer can detect magic at will. Also once per day, it can heal either its wearer or another servant of Wee Jas. The ring can communicate telepathically, and it also speaks and reads Common, Celestial, and Infernal. 

Mark of the Favored has a special purpose: to defend the servants and interests of Wee Jas. As long as its wearer remains loyal to Wee Jas, the ring can cast true resurrection on the wearer, but it can use this ability only once.
