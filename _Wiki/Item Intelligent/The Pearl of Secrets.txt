The Pearl of Secrets is a black pearl of power (8th-level spell) that claims to have been created by Vecna himself. The Pearl is highly intelligent, and it can both speak and read Common, Abyssal, Infernal, and Draconic. It can also communicate telepathically, however, and prefers this method of communication. In addition to the standard use of a pearl of power, the wielder of the Pearl of Secrets can use true seeing at will, detect thoughts three times per day, and detect secret doors at will.

The Pearl of Secrets is incredibly egotistical as well as cunning and wise. It generally insists on being in control, urging or (if possible) forcing its owner to seek after the Eye and Hand of Vecna, unearth dark secrets, and generally commit acts of despicable evil.
