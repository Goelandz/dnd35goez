This impressive name belongs to a rather uninspiring, though extremely self-confident, +1 holy kukri.

It has two moderately useful primary abilities:
Its wielder has free use of the Improved Initiative feat and can detect evil at will. It is prone to singing defiant battlesongs about slaughtering demons, switching between Common and Celestial apparently at random. 

Though convinced it is a mighty weapon against evil foes, it puts on a show of humility at times, begging to be allowed the chance to shatter on a balor’s hide or the like. Its loftiest dream is to be carried into battle by a noble halfling paladin again the last time this happened, some five centuries ago, the paladin died a grisly death.
