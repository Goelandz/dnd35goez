Shard is a +1 chaotic longsword of unknown origin, though some say it could only have been forged in the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo. Though highly intelligent, it is borderline insane, and even its magical abilities are random in nature, to say nothing of its personality. 

Each encounter, it randomly determines which of the following feats to bestow on its wielder (roll before making initiative checks):
d6 	Feat
1 	Combat Reflexes
2 	Blind-Fight
3 	Improved Initiative
4 	Mobility
5 	Sunder
6 	Expertise

Shard can also detect law at will, though what it chooses to do with the information it gains varies from day to day. Twice per day, Shard can use feeblemind on an opponent it strikes in melee (or on its wielder, if it desires). Shard speaks and reads Common, Celestial, and Abyssal, and can also communicate telepathically.
