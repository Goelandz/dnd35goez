This rod of the viper insists on the use of its full name at all times, vociferously protesting every time a wielder attempts to give it a nickname. (Past nicknames have ranged from “Minion” to “Meazel,” and it has loathed every one.) Its wielder can see invisibility and detect good at will. Minion of the Serpent Lord speaks Common, Abyssal, Infernal, and Draconic.
