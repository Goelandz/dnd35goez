Special: Seryl is made from serren, a wood found on the first layer of Arborea (see Special Materials in Chapter 3: Exalted Equipment). The wood grants Seryl the ghost touch special quality, although this is a nonmagical feature.
Languages: Elven.

Lesser Powers: Faerie fire 3/day, 10 ranks in Diplomacy (total modifier +12), 10 ranks in Spot (total modifier +12). 

Personality: Although it is over five hundred years old, the elven bow named Seryl views the world with a child’s sense of wonder. For reasons that elude it, Seryl finds dwarves especially hilarious and enjoys spending time around them, laughing at their jokes and marveling at their tales. It does not enjoy inflicting pain on others and strongly advocates taking prisoners over needless slaughter.
