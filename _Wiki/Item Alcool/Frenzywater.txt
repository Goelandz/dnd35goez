An extremely potent clear alcohol. Rumors of bottles spontaneously catching fire when exposed to sunlight have never been proven. Anyone with the rage class ability must make a Will save (DC 15) to resist flying into a rage after drinking a tankard of this liquor. If you have already expended all your rages for the day, then frenzywater has no additional effect other than making you irritable and surly. (Fortitude save DC 15.)
