Line of sight establishes whether a particular character can see something else represented on the grid. When using a grid, draw an imaginary line (or use a ruler or a piece of string) from the square the character is in to the object in question. If nothing blocks this line, the character has line of sight (and can thus see it to cast a spell on it, target it with a bow, and so forth). If the object in question is actually another creature, measure line of sight from the square the character is in to the square that the creature occupies. If a character can see a portion of a large creature that occupies more than one square, she can target that creature for a spell or any other attack.

If line of sight is completely blocked, a character can’t cast spells or use ranged weapons against the target. If it’s partially blocked, such as by the corner of a building, spells work normally but the target’s AC increases due to the cover
