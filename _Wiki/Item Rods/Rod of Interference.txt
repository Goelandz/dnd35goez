This potent device prevents the operation of other magic items. On command up to three times per day, a rod of interference shoots forth a brilliant sapphire beam that unerringly strikes a single target creature within 60 feet. 

The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 19 Will save, or the functions of all magic items currently in its possession are suppressed for 1 minute, as if they were under the effect of a targeted dispel magic.

 Moderate abjuration; 
CL 11th;
