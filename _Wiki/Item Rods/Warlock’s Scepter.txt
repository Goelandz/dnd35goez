This fearsome device is a +2 light mace with a head in the shape of a demonic horned skull. When held, it confers a +2 profane bonus on ranged touch attack rolls made with it. In addition, a warlock (or any other character capable of invoking an eldritch blast) can choose to spend charges from the scepter to increase the amount of damage his eldritch blast deals.

Extra Damage Charges
	+1d6 1 charge
	+2d6 2 charges
	+3d6 3 charges
	+4d6 5 charges

The rod’s wielder can expend up to 5 charges in any 24-hour period. A rod is created with 50 charges. After all charges are used, the rod remains a +2 light mace, but no longer provides a bonus on ranged touch attack rolls.
