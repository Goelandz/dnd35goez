This rod allows a willing user to draw a fiend or malevolent ghost into himself for possession. When the rod is activated, the wielder is automatically possessed by the nearest appropriate possessing creature, even if the creature is unwilling. The identity and attitude of the nearest spirit are often at the DM’s discretion. This rod is frequently used in unspeakable rituals of black magic.
