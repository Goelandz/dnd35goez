Beloved by warlocks, these rods augment the user's eldritch blast.

Description: Although the various types of rods of eldritch power vary somewhat in appearance, they are all made of black iron. They average 2 feet in length and are carved to resemble the straightened spine of a demonic creature. A sculpted fiendish or feylike head, clearly too small for the spine, protrudes from one end.

When the rod is used, the wielder's eldritch blast comes from the carved eyes and mouth of the sculpted head, rather than from his hand.

Activation: A rod of eldritch power requires a swift action to activate. It functions five times per day.

Effect: Each rod of eldritch power has one invocation—either a blast shape invocation or an eldritch essence invocation—contained within it. You can will it to apply this invocation to any eldritch blast you fire while holding it. This allows you to make use of blast shape or eldritch essence invocations you might not normally have, but it does not change the normal restriction that only one invocation of each type can be applied to any given blast.
