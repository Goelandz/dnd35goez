This scepter functions much like a rod of rulership, though it affects only dragons. The wielder can command the obedience and fealty of dragons within 500 feet when she activates the device (a standard action). Dragons totaling 300 Hit Dice can be ruled, but those with Intelligence scores of 16 or higher are entitled to a DC 22 Will save to negate the effect. Ruled dragons obey the wielder as if she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives a command that is contrary to the nature of the dragons commanded, the magic is broken. A rod of dragon mastery can be used for 500 minutes before it crumbles to dust. This duration need not be continuous.

There are two versions of this powerful magic item. The crimson rod of dragon mastery affects only evil and neutral dragons, while the golden rod of dragon mastery affects only good and neutral dragons.
