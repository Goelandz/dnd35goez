A boon to all casters but particularly to combat-focused arcanists, this item improves your accuracy with magical ranged attacks.

Description: A rod of magical precision is a slender rod, almost wandlike in appearance. Runes and arcane symbols travel up the rod in a spiral pattern, culminating in one great rune printed on the tip.

When the rod is active, the runes pulse with energy, starting at the handle and working up to the top. The spell appears to emanate from the rod rather than from your own hand.

Activation: The primary function of a rod of magical precision works as long as you hold the item in one or both hands, requiring no action to activate. It has no limit on daily uses.

The secondary function of the rod requires no specific action to activate, merely an act of will made as part of casting a spell. It functions up to three times per day.

Effect: While you are holding a rod of magical precision, any ranged attack you make with a spell or spell-like ability at an opponent engaged in melee does not take the standard –4 penalty on your attack roll. 

In addition, you can choose for your spell or spell-like ability to ignore the miss chance granted to a target by concealment or total concealment. In the case of a target that has total concealment, you must still aim at the correct square.
