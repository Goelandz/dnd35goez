This potent rod feeds off the wielder's draconic bloodline to enhance his magical abilities. 

While a sorcerer can access the rod's power, true dragons gain even greater benefit. 

Description: This 5-foot-long, russetstained rod is carved from the bone of a dragon and covered in draconic runes. When the rod is activated, dark red blood runs down the rod, soaking the hand of the wielder. 

Prerequisite: A Greater rod of dragon's blood functions only for characters of the dragon type or the dragonblood subtype, as well as for any character with at least 1 level of sorcerer. 

Activation: Activating a lesser rod of dragon's blood requires the same action normally required to cast the chosen spell (see Effect, below). The rod can be activated three times 
per day. 

Effect: When activated, A greater rod of dragon's blood allows the wielder to recast any spell of up to 4th level he cast in the previous round, or to reuse any spell-like ability of up to 4th level it used in the previous round. It otherwise functions as a lesser rod of dragon's blood. 

Wielders of the dragon type instead can reuse any spell-like ability of up to 2nd level that they used in the previous round. This doesn't count against their normal daily limit for that spell-like ability. 

The rod also functions as a quarterstaff.
