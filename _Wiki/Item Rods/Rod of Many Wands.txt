This device, perhaps one of the stranger rods ever created, allows you to utilize more than one wand at a single time.

Description: A rod of many wands is made of steel and constructed in two distinct parts. The handle end, wrapped in leather, is roughly as thick as the handle of a mace, while the top end is roughly twice that in diameter. Each makes up about half the length of the rod. The upper end contains three depressions running down its length, each one designed to hold a wand in place.

Activation: In order to make use of a rod of many wands, you must first load it with as many as three wands you wish to use. Each wand requires a full-round action to load (or a move action to remove). After one or more wands are loaded into the rod, they can all be activated by a single command word unique to the rod. This utterance is a complex phrase in Draconic, and speaking it requires a full-round action, rather than the standard action normally required for command word activation.

Effect: With this rod, you can trigger multiple wands at once. Although you are not required to fill all three depressions, you cannot selectively activate the wands that you have loaded; activating the rod triggers every wand connected to it. This process drains a number of charges from each wand equal to the number of wands loaded into the rod. For instance, if you have fully loaded the rod, each use drains three charges from each wand.
