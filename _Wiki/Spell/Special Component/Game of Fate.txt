Long ago, someone discovered that a die carved from the shell of a large tortoise attracts the attention of the deities of luck. When used as a component in the casting of any spell that grants a bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, or checks, such a die—known as a game of fate—produces one of three effects: +1 caster level (01-45), double duration (46-90), or restoration of a spell as per a pearl of power (91-100).
