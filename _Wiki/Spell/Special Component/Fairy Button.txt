These small bits of stone resemble brightly colored mushrooms or flowers. They occur naturally in caverns where the groundwater has the correct mineral content.

They get their name from their minuscule size and bright colors—usually red, yellow, green or purple or some variegated combination that includes some or all of those hues.

When incorporated into an illusion spell, a fairy button doubles the area of the spell, as if affected by the Widen Spell feat.
