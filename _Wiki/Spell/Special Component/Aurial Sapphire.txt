On rare occasions, the winds of the Elemental Plane of Air capture various particles whipping about in the emptiness and drive them together over the course of years. The result is a crystal marbled in various shades of blue. Called aurial sapphires, these gemstones are sometimes found oh the Material Plane, usually at high altitudes where the winds blow most fiercely. When an aurial sapphire is used as a component in the casting of any Air domain spell or spell that has the air descriptor, the spell is affected as if by the Quicken Spell feat, but without 
any level increase. 

Price: 215 gp.
