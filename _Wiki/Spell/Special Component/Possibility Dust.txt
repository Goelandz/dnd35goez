This iridescent gray material is gathered in the depths of the Astral Plane. Planar scholars believe that possibility dust is literally distilled reality that somehow seeps from the Material Plane to the Astral Plane, where it settles as fine dust. This assertion is unproven; however, spellcasters have found the substance useful when attempt to create something out of nothing.

When possibility dust is incorporated into any creation spell, the spell's duration doubles, as if affected by the Extend Spell feat.
