Captured in glass by a special process known only to angels themselves, the radiance of an angel is a potent component. Used as a component for a banishment or dismissal spell, or a dispel evil spell used to drive a fiend back to its home plane, a phial of angel radiance increases the saving throw DC by +1. It also grants the caster a +1 bonus on her caster level check to overcome the target’s spell resistance. Angel radiance sheds light as a torch.
