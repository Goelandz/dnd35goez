 This material resembles dried snake's tongues, hence the name. In fact, it is a mixture of cured tongues of various rare birds and reptiles and the dried stamens of several kinds of tropical flowers. All the ingredients must be painstakingly gathered by hand and carefully mixed in the correct proportions.

When used in an enchantment spell, serpent's tongue doubles the spell's duration, as if affected by the Extend Spell feat.
