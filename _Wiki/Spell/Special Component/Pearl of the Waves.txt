A pearl of the waves results when an oyster forms a pearl around the tiniest fragment of a magic item, such as a sliver of a magic blade or wood from a broken staff. If this pearl is used as a component in the casting of any Water domain spell or a spell that has the water descriptor, the spell is affected as if by the Quicken Spell feat, but without any change in spell slot. 

Price: 225 gp.
