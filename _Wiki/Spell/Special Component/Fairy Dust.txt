This fine powder is all but invisible in daylight, but it gleams with a silvery sheen in moonlight. Fey creatures supposedly collect it from newly blossomed wood flowers each spring. In fact, fairy dust is made of the dried and powdered cocoons of certain rare moths that breed in the spring.

When used in any transmutation spell, fairy dust doubles the duration of the spell, as if affected by the Extend Spell feat.
