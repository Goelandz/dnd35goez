Reputedly the dried tears of dragons, these irregular little crystals have a milky white color with a faint blue tinge. They are found near mineral springs and volcanic vents (both locales with a decidedly draconic character).

When used in any fire or mind-affecting spell, a dragon's tear increases the spell's level by one, as if affected by the Heighten Spell feat.
