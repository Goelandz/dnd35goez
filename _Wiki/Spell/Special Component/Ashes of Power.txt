When a used scroll is burned and its ashes are mixed with holy water and mystical inks, the resulting paste houses an ember of true magic. When used as a component in the casting of dispel magic, greater dispel magic, or break enchantment, this powder allows the caster to make two dispel checks and choose the better result.
