When an animal dies while under the effect of a magic fang or greater magic fang spell, one of its claws or teeth sometimes retains a spark of that magic. This so-called talon of Ehlonna resists decay and gains a goldbronze luster over time. When used as a component in the casting of any Animal domain spell or a spell that specifically targets animals, the talon increases the effective caster level by 2. 

Price: 370 gp.
