When coated in a thin layer of powdered mithral, the tailfeathers of an albatross or an arrowhawk gain a degree of magical power. If one of these so-called feathers of the far reaches is used as a component in the casting of any Travel domain spell, it either adds 10 feet to the speed (if the spell grants a new or improved mode of movement) or increases the effective caster level by 1.
