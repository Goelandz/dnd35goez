This granular material appears as metallic sand, though it actually comes from the Ethereal Plane. Spellcasters have found that they can shape it as part of spellcasting to take on other forms. Unlike other components described here, spells of higher than 1st level don't automatically require multiple units of primal essence.

A pinch of primal essence dust can be substituted for any material component (but not a focus) that costs 100 gp or less. Multiple pinches have an additive effect; three pinches, for example, could substitute for the 250 gp of diamond dust required by stoneskin.
