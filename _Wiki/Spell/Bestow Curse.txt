ALTERNATIVE CURSES
When a spellcaster uses bestow curse (see Chapter 11 of the Player’s Handbook), the following curses can be substituted for those given in the spell description.

• Target is rendered sterile.
• The next person introduced to the target for the first time will hate him or her uncontrollably forever. Even if this curse is removed, the person still hates the victim of the curse, but the victim can improve the person’s attitude normally after the curse is gone.
• Each time the target attempts to help a friend or ally, there is a 50% chance the attempt fails and causes the ally to fail at the task.
• Target is struck blind and deaf.
• Each round in combat, there is a 25% chance that the target will attack the nearest creature rather than choosing an opponent normally.
• Every time the victim makes a d20 roll, a roll of 20 counts as a 1.
• The victim effectively ages, moving him or her to the beginning of the next age category. See Chapter 6 of the Player’s Handbook for the effects of aging.
• At some point within the next week (or whenever it is feasible), thieves are able to steal all monetary wealth the victim has.
• Animals refuse to be within 5 feet of the target and do not respond to the target’s commands or requests.
• Each time the target meets someone for the first time, there is a 50% chance that the new person will confuse the target with a hated enemy, a well-known criminal, or a raving lunatic.
• All creatures of a specific kind (such as orcs, owlbears, or black dragons) are permanently invisible to the sight of the victim (invisibility purge does not help, but see invisibility and true seeing do). The spellcaster chooses the kind of
creature.
• A random friend or family member of the target contracts a disease. If the disease is magically cured or runs its course (regardless of the outcome), another loved one contracts a new disease.
• The target’s most powerful and/or cherished item falls apart, becoming forever useless.
• Valuable metals (such as platinum, gold, silver, and copper) turn to lead in the target’s possession, even if they are in a bag of holding or stored away from the target. The target’s touch transmutes valuable metals (including coins) into lead as well.
• 1d4+1 of the target’s loved ones or allies are affected by a curse chosen from the bestow curse list above.
• All of the target’s loved ones and allies suddenly despise him and are considered to have unfriendly attitudes. See NPC Attitudes in Chapter 5 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide for actions former allies might take.
• The target cannot cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or activate spell completion or spell trigger items
