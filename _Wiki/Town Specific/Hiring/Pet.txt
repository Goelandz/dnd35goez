Animated Object: A wizard might animate objects around her house and then grow fond of them. If left animated long enough, they usually develop quirks that resemble personality.

Dog: These animals make excellent pets, regardless of their HD or size.

Elemental: The Monster Manual doesn’t mention elementals below Small size, but it’s safe to assume that Tiny or Diminutive elementals with animal intelligence could exist. A fire elemental might seem a dangerous pet, but if it “lived” in the hearth, it might well enjoy a simple existence there. 

Homunculus: Unusually intelligent for a construct, a homunculus shares its creator’s mindset. It
literally lives to serve, making it an excellent pet if that is all its creator asks of it.

Pseudodragon: These dragons live to be pampered, and their sole ambition seems to be comfort. Pseudodragons are perfectly happy to be thought of as pets, as long they eat well and are treated with the respect they feel they deserve.
