Evil or unusually twisted masters employ these hideous outsiders to guard their valuables. Predictably, vargouilles most often guard tombs and mausoleums from graverobbers. Clever despots also hide them outside their palaces among rows of pikes topped with severed heads.

Vargouilles have little personality and no easily discernible response to reward or punishment.

These qualities make them tough to train.
