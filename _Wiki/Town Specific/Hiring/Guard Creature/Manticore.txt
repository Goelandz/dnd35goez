With their flight and spike volley abilities, manticores are best employed as guards in wide-open spaces. Manticores quickly grow bored when left to guard a stationary object. They spend long, dull hours setting up elaborate blinds and ambushes or
inventing ways to extort more payment or favors from their masters. Especially because of the latter habit, manticores are better employed as bodyguards or hunters. When protecting a person, a manticore passes the time in subtly threatening
conversation, trying to catch its charge in logic traps or pointing out how a clever attacker could separate the two of them and kill the charge. This is a manticore’s way of demonstrating that it is alert and aware of its surroundings. Few clients seem to appreciate the effort.
