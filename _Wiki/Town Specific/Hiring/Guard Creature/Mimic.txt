Mimics are near-perfect property guards. They’re intelligent, they speak Common, and they are willing to sit still for years at a time as long as they are paid in treasure and food for their trouble. A mimic’s main drawback is its potential disloyalty. It
can sometimes be bought off if an intruder offers better rewards. In addition, if intruders prove too strong, a mimic might bargain information for its life. Under no circumstances, though, will a mimic surrender treasure.

Mimics reject attempts at formal training—they instinctively know how to guard items and places, and they have little desire to protect people. Would-be trainers must use Diplomacy instead of Handle Animal to get a mimic to do something it does not want to do. Fortunately, mimics are unskilled diplomats.

No young mimic has ever been found. It is unknown how or if mimics reproduce.
