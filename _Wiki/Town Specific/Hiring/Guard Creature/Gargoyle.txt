Gargoyles are excellent guardians, but only for as long as they choose to be. They are best left in places that the owner does not expect to visit very often, since they can be antagonistic toward even the person who placed them.

Gargoyles serve only powerful or persuasive masters, and even then they must be convinced that plenty of foolish prey will attempt to get past them while they wait in place. Geas or quest spells also work well. Gargoyles do not submit to training.
