Hell hounds are aggressive hunters that get restless if enclosed and left alone to protect some place or object. Evil masters can use them as guardians, but they must let the hounds roam and hunt as they please. One or two hell hounds can serve as personal guards, or packs can be kept in infernal kennels for an occasional round of “the most dangerous game.”

Although hell hounds and howlers have similar needs and can do many of the same things, they cannot be kept near one another—the two fight viciously.
