Blink dog packs try to prevent it, but opportunists sometimes steal their pups and train them as guard creatures. Some are treated horribly by abusive masters. Being both intelligent and lawful good, blink dogs trained in such an environment are reluctant guards, but like slaves raised in captivity, they are too beaten and ignorant of freedom to disobey orders.

On rare occasions, a pack of blink dogs serve as guardians and friends for a tribe of wild elves or a lawful good person who has done a great service to the pack. In these instances, the blink dogs require no training and act of their own volition. At no time, however, are they considered domesticated or tame.
