Dire bats are saddled with so many evil associations, one would hardly think of adding a rider too. Yet they make excellent mounts. Some riders prefer dire bats to the more willful giant eagles or owls, if for no other reason than that they do not have the same pesky good alignment associations. 

Bat riding is difficult since it commonly occurs in the dark, and the bat’s blindsight has much longer range than most riders’ darkvision. Riders must pay close attention to their mounts’ movement and allow it to help steer. In low-light conditions, the DM might increase the Ride check DC, given that the bat reacts to things the rider is unaware of.
