“Mean as a wasp” is a cliché for good reason. When a giant wasp takes damage in combat, it attempts to attack the person who hurt it exclusively. As a moveequivalent action, a rider must succeed on a Ride check (DC 20) to get the wasp to disengage or attack another foe. A rider involved in such a skirmish usually finds it easier just to go where the wasp wants. Giant wasps make excellent fast-strike mounts for elite soldiers.
