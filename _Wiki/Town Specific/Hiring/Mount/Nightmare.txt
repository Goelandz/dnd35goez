Nightmares are untrainable. They do as they will and do not suffer fools. Even powerful evil creatures must dominate nightmares to ride them as mounts, either magically or through sheer force of will. Afterward, a nightmare serves willingly, but only as long as it thinks its master is a means to more power and pleasure for itself. Since a nightmare’s greatest pleasure is to spread evil and fear, this is an easy achievement.
