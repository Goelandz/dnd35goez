Lizard, Riding
These carnivorous lizards are almost exclusively
Underdark mounts, rarely seen on the surface and
jealously guarded by their breeders. They are so protected because they have sticky pads on their feet that
allow them to climb walls—a necessity for getting
about in unpredictable underground passages. These
creatures stand 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh
around 600 pounds.
