Halfling paladins who call for a mount have occasionally been rewarded with a willing blink dog, which gains all paladin mount abilities but retains its higher Intelligence. Blink dogs have also been known to serve other good masters who have done their packs a great service. Over time, a blink dog mount begins to think of its associated adventuring party as its new pack, and it occasionally tests some member of the party to find dominance. A blink dog always considers its rider to be the pack alpha.

If a blink dog’s rider wears a ring of blinking, the dog and ring attune to each other through a sympathetic magical effect so that dog and rider blink in unison. No effect has been discovered that allows a blink dog to teleport with its rider using dimension door. However, blink dogs and their riders often develop flanking routines and quick getaways that make good use of this ability.
