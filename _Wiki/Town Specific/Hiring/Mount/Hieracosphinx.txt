These sphinxes look much like griffons, and the two can be easily confused at a distance. A hieracosphinx is tougher and stronger than a griffon, but the greatest difference is its evil nature. A griffon attacks only when riled or hungry, and it makes an excellent flying mount when trained. A hieracosphinx enjoys fighting for its own sake and is a contentious mount, regardless of training. 

However fearsome a foe it may be, a hieracosphinx is predictably distracted by the appearance of a gynosphinx. Clever illusionists keep this ace up their sleeves against a rider on one of these magical beasts.
