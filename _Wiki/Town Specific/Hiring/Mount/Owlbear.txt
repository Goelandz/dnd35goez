Owlbear
Only the brave or foolish ride owlbears. Foolishness, at least, is never in short supply.

The primary training method for owlbears is pain. Most good members of the common races consider the exercise cruel, even for owlbears. However, only repeated, excessive beatings have consistently been proven to work, first to train an owlbear not to attack its trainer, and eventually to allow a rider. Magic renders an owlbear docile for a short time. Unlike other creatures, though, when the enchantment ends, the owlbear reverts, forgetting anything it learned.

Regardless of the frequency or severity of beatings, owlbears are incurably hateful and turn on their riders at the first sign of weakness. Any time a rider takes more than 15 points of damage in a single round, he must make a Ride check to control his mount in battle (DC 20). If he fails, the owlbear immediately tries to throw the rider (DC 20 Ride check to stay in the saddle) and ignores other opponents. If the rider ever falls from the saddle, the owlbear attacks him immediately.
