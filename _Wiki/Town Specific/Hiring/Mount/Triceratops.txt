Working with a triceratops is all about teamwork. A team of four to six dwarves rears a young triceratops, usually with magic training devices; it’s the only way to consistently get good results. Once the dinosaur is on the battlefield, teamwork continues. One rider sits high on the creature’s neck, receiving one-half cover from most attacks thanks to the bone plate jutting up and around from its head. Meanwhile, up to four more dwarves armed with crossbows and polearms lay into opponents from the beast’s back. A howdah is often used for this purpose.
