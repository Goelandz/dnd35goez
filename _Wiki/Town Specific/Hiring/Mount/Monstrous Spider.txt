Like monstrous scorpions, Large spiders are too gangly and ride too low to be good mounts. Specimens of at least Huge size are required. Those who can actually tame spiders of this size find hunters to be better mounts than web spinners, since they are more inclined toward moving and stalking rather than weaving webs and waiting. Like giant preying mantises, however, web-spinning spiders are good for stationary duty, such as guarding gates.
