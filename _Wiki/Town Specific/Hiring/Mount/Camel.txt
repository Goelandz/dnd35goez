Camels are favored mounts in the desert. When fully stocked, a camel can travel up to a week with little food and no water. Further, camels require no shoeing or fussy grooming as horses do. Dromedary camels (one hump) are best for riding, while bactrians (two humps) are best for carrying cargo. Camels are thought to be bad-tempered and to carry grudges against people who mistreat them, getting revenge by kicking or spitting. Actually, while no creature likes being mistreated, camels are fairly patient and hard workers.
