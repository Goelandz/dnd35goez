Many dwarves love the solid feel of a war rhinoceros beneath them. A rhino’s willingness to charge enemies only endears it further to them. A rhinoceros has a nearly prehensile upper lip, which it mainly uses for feeding.

With training, though, a rhino can hold and carry delicate items such as a potion vial with its lip.
