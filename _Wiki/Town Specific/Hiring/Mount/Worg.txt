Goblins and worgs are a potent combination, but not the only one. Some orc and hobgoblin tribes have been known to breed Large worgs as mounts too.

The fact that worgs can speak is often overlooked by adventurers. Their unique howling and barking speech is understandable at greater distances (to someone who knows the language) than regular voices, and they have no qualms about using language to coordinate tactics and communicate scouting information. Unsuspecting adventurers hear only wolf howls when volumes are being told. As mounts, worgs can also convey this information to their riders. This ability allows bands of evil humanoids to appear supernaturally well informed about events around the countryside.
