Worker ants are tireless pack animals, and soldier ants are fast, fearless mounts. Both also have the useful ability to climb vertical surfaces with a rider. Due to their connection with the queen, though, ants can be difficult to separate from the hive and tame. To solve this problem, alchemists have developed an admixture that makes the drinker smell like a queen ant (see the sidebar).
