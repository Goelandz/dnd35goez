Though these creatures are savage in the wild, girallons captured young can make hearty mounts for primitive tribespeople. However, riders must keep a tight rein on them, since it is impossible to train away a girallon’s aggression and territoriality. Although they are not as unrelentingly mean as owlbears, girallons require many of the same training strategies.
