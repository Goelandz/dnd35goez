Riding on the outside of a purple worm is impossible, so mind flayers ride inside it. They place an irritant inside a purple worm’s mouth that causes the growth of a large cyst. After a cyst reaches roughly 6 feet in diameter, the illithid drains its new “cyst saddle” and rides in the worm’s mouth. The cyst’s membrane is stretched so thin that it is nearly transparent. The mind flayer uses charm monster to keep the worm compliant during training, but since purple worms have no language, illithid riders must lower themselves to issuing commands verbally in Undercommon.

A purple worm with a cyst saddle in its mouth can swallow only Medium-size or smaller creatures. If the worm successfully swallows a creature whole, that creature can make an attack of opportunity against the cyst (AC 5) as he or she passes. An opponent balancing on or flying into the worm’s maw without being swallowed can also attack the cyst. Until torn, the cyst provides full cover for the rider inside. However, its membrane is delicate—only 10 points of damage tears the cyst and exposes the illithid inside to the worm’s maw as well. Because of this danger, experienced riders order their mounts to swallow whole only when victory is certain and they wish to see a foe’s terror-stricken face on the way to oblivion. Purple worms have no place for cargo. Riders must carry any cargo on their persons.
