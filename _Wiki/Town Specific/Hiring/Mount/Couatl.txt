Even the most powerful, beneficent paladins lose their warhorses in righteous battle. When such a paladin calls for a new mount to continue the fight against depredations of the wicked, a couatl sometimes answers, serving as a steady mount and advisor. When serving this way, a couatl does not receive a paladin mount’s bonus HD, natural armor, or Strength adjustment. It keeps its natural Intelligence, but it does gain special abilities appropriate for the level of paladin it bonds to.

Riding one of these magnificent outsiders in a dignified manner is difficult, but well worth the effort. All Ride check DCs are 5 higher than normal due to the couatl’s sinuous method of flying. On the other hand, a couatl requires no training, and it gladly accepts the role of mount and servant in the battle against evil.

Couatls love to offer their advice on arcana, history, nature, or any area in which they have Knowledge ranks. Though never intrusive, they like to show off their learning and sometimes offer more advice than is technically necessary.

Theoretically, a young couatl might be given to a respected ruler or temple for training, as parents might entrust a child to be raised in a monastery. A brazen bandit might also make her way to the celestial planes and steal an egg. In these cases, a couatl might be trained at a site removed from its native plane. Adults are not likely to consent to such treatment, though, and can never be considered domesticated.
