Halfling riding dogs are hard workers, famed for their ferocity and loyalty on the battlefield. Though stoic animals, riding dogs hate to be left tied up “with the mounts.” They prefer to lounge by the fire with their masters at night. In the wild, this is sometimes even a preferable arrangement. However, too much socialization is usually not in a working dog’s best interests, since it can begin to forget its training. Some masters are permissive anyway and even allow them indoors. Housebreaking a riding dog counts as a trick.
