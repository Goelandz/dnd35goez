An ogre sometimes straps a goblin with a crossbow to its back and uses the little wretch as a tail gunner. Clever goblins (of which there are a few) nurture this relationship, praising their new “mount” and doing nice things for the ogre. Over time, the goblin can manipulate the ogre enough that the ogre not only does whatever its rider wants but believes it to be its own idea.

From time to time, communities of Small folk have raised an ogre baby as one of their own. It grows up friendly to its adopted family and gladly lets them ride piggyback, especially if it can roam with its friends.
