These vermin make excellent search and rescue creatures. Their abdomens glow a soft yellow or green and shed light in a 10-foot radius. A common trick that riders direct giant fireflies to perform is “Light.” This keeps a firefly’s phosphorescent abdomen lit indefinitely while the riders search for ground targets. Giant fireflies make poor combatants, so their riders flee battle as soon as possible. A giant firefly is 9 feet long.

Training a Giant Firefly: Training a giant firefly as a mount requires a successful Handle Animal check (DC 30). Giant firefly eggs are worth 300 gp on the open market. Professional trainers charge 300 gp to tame a giant firefly.

Riding a giant firefly requires an exotic saddle. A giant firefly can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.
