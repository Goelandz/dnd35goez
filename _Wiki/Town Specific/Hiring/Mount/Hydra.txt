Hydras are insanely difficult to train, more so than even an experienced trainer might guess. Each head must be trained independently, and untrained heads do not wait patiently for their turns. Trainers must use aggressive magical aid to even begin the training process; a spellcaster can make a decent living just casting charm monster every few days to keep the other heads docile while the trainer works with a single head. Training the largest hydras can take years, and failed Handle Animal checks can be disastrous. For this reason, any trainer who consents to even attempt this task usually refuses to train a hydra with more than five or six heads.
