Although single-minded, rust monsters make surprisingly good mounts. When fed generously and treated well, they become friendly and even affectionate, crowding around, uttering a staccato chit-chit-chit noise, and making feathery strokes with their antennae against the faces of trainers approaching with bags of scrap metal.
