This cold, 50-foot-square chamber is covered in a thin sheet of ice. On the opposite side of the room is a 5-foot-square block of ice that contains a treasure or blocks the exit. The trap is activated when anyone approaches to within 10 feet of the block of ice. A jet of freezing water sprays down from the ceiling of the chamber, hitting anyone ithin 10 feet of the block of ice. 

Some of this water freezes in the chamber, but much of it flows down a series of drains. The block of ice regains 20 hit points each round if the nozzle above it continues to function.
