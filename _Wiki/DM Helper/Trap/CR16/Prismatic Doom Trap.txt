This 50-foot-square chamber is coated in shimmering silver foil that reflects the light emitted from large silver mirrors in each corner. A 10-foot section of floor in the center of the room contains a trapdoor with four locks (Open Lock DC 35 for each). Beyond the door is a passageway or hidden treasure. The trap is activated when anyone approaches to within 10 feet of the trapdoor. At that point, one of the four mirrors (determined randomly) releases a heightened prismatic spray each round, affecting the entire room except for a few squares in the opposite corner. Until only one mirror remains, no square in the room is safe from the effect.
