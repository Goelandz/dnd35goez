This deadly trap combines two powerful spell effects to destroy intruders. In the center of a 30-foot-square chamber of polished black stone is a skull made of pure diamond. The trap activates when anyone approaches to within 5 feet of the skull. When that occurs, the skull glows with an unholy light, and anyone who makes contact with the skull (including with a melee weapon) begins to caper and dance. Green rays shoot from the skull’s eye sockets, draining the life from random targets. A door on the opposite side of the room can be opened only after the trap is disarmed or destroyed.
