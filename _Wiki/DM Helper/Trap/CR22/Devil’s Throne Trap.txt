Description This powerful trap is built into a large and elaborately carved throne room with a diabolic motif. Relief sculptures of stone wings, six extended claws, and a coiled tail reach out from a throne centered on the far wall. When the trap is triggered, each stone limb ignites with magical fire and attacks. Meanwhile, the throne uses magic to hold foes in place so that the fiendish limbs can crush them. 

Destroying the throne deactivates the entire trap. This trap is usually found as part of the seat of power of a pit fiend or other mighty devil (encountering the trap and a pit fiend together raises the CR to 23).
