In this 60-foot-by-30-foot chamber, six deep grooves in the floor stretch from wall to wall, filling the entire room. Alcoves on both sides of the room hold large boulders. A pressure plate just inside the door activates the trap, causing each boulder to tumble out of its alcove and roll along its groove until it comes to rest in the alcove in the opposite wall. A boulder travels the full 60-foot length of the room in a single round. Roll 1d6 each round to determine which groove releases its boulder. Creatures in the path of that boulder are subject to bludgeoning damage if they fail a save. In addition, all creatures in the room are targeted by hold monster spells each round.
