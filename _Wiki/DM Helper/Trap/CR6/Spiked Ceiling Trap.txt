Description This 40-foot square chamber has a single entrance and exit. The trap is activated by a pressure plate in the floor in front of the exit door, causing both doors to close immediately. They open again when the trap is disarmed or its duration has expired. The ceiling is covered in spikes that randomly descend each round to attack every square in the chamber. Four chain pulley mechanisms, one set into each wall, control the spikes. Disabling or destroying a mechanism reduces the number of spikes that attack each round.
