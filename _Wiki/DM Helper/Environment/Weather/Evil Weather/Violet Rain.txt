Always accompanied by a terrible thunderstorm filled with lightning, violet rain brings portents of great evil. Once violet rain begins to fall, all connection with divine agencies is severed for 24 hours. Divine spellcasters have no access to spells, divine spell effects are suppressed, and divinely infused magic items cease to function. When violet rain comes, leaders of temples often hire extra help to safeguard the temple while they are bereft of magic. Because violet rain is so disruptive, religious leaders sometimes use divinations and prophecies to gain as much warning as they can.

A typical violet rainstorm covers 1d10×200 square miles.
