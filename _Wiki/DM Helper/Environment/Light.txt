 Creatures with low-light vision can see objects twice as far away as the given distance, just as they do by torchlight 
or lantern light. Similarly, creatures with darkvision can see out to the extent of their darkvision.

Murky Water: Water containing a lot of sediment, debris, or organic matter is often quite murky. Most rivers and lakes are murky, while some are very murky.

 Murky water reduces the radius of illumination provided by a light source (the sun or a carried light source, such as 
an object with a light spell cast on it) by 50%, since light scatters and reflects from matter hanging in the water. For 
example, a sunrod normally provides bright illumination to a range of 30 feet and shadowy illumination to 60 feet, 
but in murky water these are reduced to 15 feet and 30 feet, respectively.

 Very murky or muddy water obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment (20% miss chance).
