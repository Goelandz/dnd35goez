This suit of armor feels like mithral chainmail to the touch, but the miniscule rings are a pale green, turning brighter when the millennial chainmail is in the sun. Millennial chainmail functions as +3 chainmail, but it has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +8, an armor check penalty of –2, and an arcane spell failure chance of 15%. It is considered light armor. Millennial chainmail painlessly extends tiny green roots into the wearer’s skin, granting fast healing 3 as long as the wearer is standing in better than shadowy illumination.

To use this relic, you must worship Corellon Larethian and either sacrifi ce a 4th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 7 HD.
