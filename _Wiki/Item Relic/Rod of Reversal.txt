This steel rod looks like a length of thick chain, but it doesn’t bend even the slightest. On command, it automatically refl ects the next nine levels of spells cast at the wearer, exactly as if spell turning had been cast upon the wearer. It also grants its wielder the Improved Counterspelling feat.

Turning a spell changes the rod of reversal’s color, depending on the school of the spell turned.

School 		Color
Abjuration 	Blue
Conjuration 	Yellow
Divination 	Indigo
Enchantment 	Green
Evocation 	Red
Illusion 	Violet
Necromancy 	Black
Transmutation 	Orange
