This black, thousand-faceted gem is said to be carved by Garl Glittergold himself. 

Worn like a brooch, a gem of the glitterdepth grants its owner a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and the instinctive knowledge of where the walls, ceiling, and fl oor are in any cavern he’s in, no matter how big the cavern is or what the illumination is.

 To use this relic, you must worship Garl Glittergold and either sacrifice a 5th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 9 HD.
