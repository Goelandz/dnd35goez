 Once in a great while, Gruumsh flings a spear at a cleric he’s annoyed with. If that cleric then atones for the transgression and keeps the spear, it becomes a spear of retribution. This +2 spear of returning becomes a +4 spear of returning whenever its wielder attacks someone who dealt damage to the wielder in the previous round. If the wielder received a critical hit in the last round from the target, the spear of retribution becomes a +5 keen spear of returning against that foe.

To use this relic, you must worship Gruumsh and either sacrifi ce a 5th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 9 HD.
