These slick metal gauntlets slowly drip blood, seemingly from nowhere. They grant their wearer 
a +4 luck bonus on melee touch attacks. 

Furthermore, any touch spell the wearer casts is maximized as though using the Maximize Spell feat, although the spell doesn’t use a higher-level spell slot.

To use this relic, you must worship Hextor and either sacrifice a 6th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 11 HD.
