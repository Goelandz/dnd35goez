Originally one of three such hoods worn by Xeric IV, who publicly executed every member of his own extended family two centuries ago, the executioner’s hoods have been scattered across the globe by tides of war and conquest. The wearer of an executioner’s hood(which takes up the headband body slot) can make a coup de grace attacks as a standard action rather than a full action. 

Whenever he succeeds at a coup de grace attempt, he gains a +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution for the next 5 minutes that is cumulative with each successful coup de grace attempt (+10 max).

To use this relic, you must worship Erythnul and either sacrifice a 6th-level divine spell 
slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 11 HD.
