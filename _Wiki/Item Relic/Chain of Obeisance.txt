It is said that these +2 unholy spiked chains are made from the shackles in Hextor’shellish prison-fortress. Despite their size and unwieldiness, they can be wielded in a grapple, and anyone pinned by a foe wielding a chain of obeisance must succeed on a Will save (DC 22) or be dominated (as the dominate monster spell)

To use this relic, you must worship Hextor and either sacrifice a 7th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 13 HD.
