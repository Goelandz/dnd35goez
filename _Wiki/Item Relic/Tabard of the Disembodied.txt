While on the Ethereal Plane, the spells you cast affect the Material Plane normally, unlike those of spellcasters who reach the Ethereal Plane by another means.

To use this relic, you must worship Nerull and either sacrifice a 7th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 13 HD.
