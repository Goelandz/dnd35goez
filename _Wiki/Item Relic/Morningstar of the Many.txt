It is said that these morningstars have been dipped in the blood of creatures from every known plane on the Great Wheel. Until the command word is spoken, the morningstar of the many is a +2 morningstar covered with carved, laughing mouths. But once commanded into action, it becomes a weapon that takes on a different set of weapon qualities each round:

Round 	Weapon Qualities
1 	+4 anarchic morningstar
2 	+4 wounding battleaxe
3 	+4 unholy morningstar
4 	+1 vorpal longsword
5 	+4 flaming burst morningstar
6 	+4 vicious shortspear
After the sixth round, the morningstar of the many is again a +2 morningstar until the command word is given anew.
