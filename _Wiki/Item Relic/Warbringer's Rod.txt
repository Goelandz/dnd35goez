A boon to warriors everywhere, a warbringer's rod allows soldiers and fighters to mystically augment their abilities without waiting for assistance from an allied spellcaster.

Description: A warbringer's rod is a heavy bar of iron with a steel head at the top. The head is flanged, allowing it to function as a mace.

When one of the rod's magical abilities is activated, the handle grows warm, and the wielder hears a battle cry reverberating in his head.

Activation: The normal enhancement bonus of a warbringer's rod and the feat-related benefit require no activation to function.

The spell effects contained within a warbringer's rod require a command word to activate; this takes a standard action. The specific words vary from rod to rod, but include phrases such as “Grant me strength!” and “Let blood flow!”

Once it is activated, a warbringer's rod cannot be activated again until an arcane spell of 3rd level or higher has been placed into it (much as the way a ring of spell storing functions, though the precise spell doesn't matter).

Effect: A warbringer's rod functions as a +1 heavy mace. If the wielder has any feats that apply only to a specific weapon (such as Weapon Focus), he can apply the feats' benefit to this weapon as well.

In addition, when it is activated, the rod casts both bear's endurance and bull's strength on the wielder simultaneously.

These spells remain active as long as the wielder holds the rod (up to the normal duration of each spell).
