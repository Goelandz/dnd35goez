This rolled-up sheet of vellum, often kept in a darkwood tube, is a boon to caravans of halfl ing pilgrims, who use it to avoid danger and make their way through the wilderness.

 Once per day, the map of unseen lands can be commanded to spend two minutes redrawing itself, mapping the terrain within a 16-mile radius with total accuracy but only middling detail.

 The DM should spend two minutes of real time sketching out such a map, working down the following list in terms of priority:
• General terrain features (mountains, rivers, and so forth) labeled if their names are widely known.
• Structures of more than 5,000 square feet (castles, temples, ruins) named either specifi cally (Fortress of the Undying) or generally (bardic college).
• Structures important for travel (bridges, dungeon entrances, magic portals), labeled only if they’re unusual in some respect.
• Lairs of creatures with more than 15 Hit Dice, labeled by creature type only.

 The map of unseen lands doesn’t function underground.

To use this relic, you must worship Yondalla and either sacrifi ce a 5th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 9 HD.
