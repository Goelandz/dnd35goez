Personality: The dagger of denial takes great glee in disrupting other spellcasters, giggling and cackling to its wielder as it counters their spells. It generally readies an action to counterspell with dispel magic each round, then uses its Spellcraft ability to discern which enemy spells are worth dispelling. If its wielder attacks in melee, the dagger attempts a feint in combat immediately prior to its wielder’s attack. Four daggers of denial are known to exist; they were originally gifts from Vecna to wizards he charged with keeping his priests in line. A dagger of denial happily lets anyone wield it, and it’ll cheerfully lie about its powers and purpose (using its Bluff skill). But if a wielder doesn’t worship Vecna and obey the relic rules, she doesn’t get access to the dagger of denial’s powers and the dagger betrays her at the fi rst available opportunity. A dagger of denial who’s working against its wielder starts by surreptitiously dispelling the spells of the wielder and her allies, leaving them without the magic that they’re depending on.

To use this relic, you must worship Vecna and either sacrifi ce an 8th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 15 HD.
