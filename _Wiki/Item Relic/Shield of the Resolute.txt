This +2 mithral moderate fortifi cation heavy shield is made from hundreds of strips of mithral, each a different size, riveted together. It is said that shields of the resolute are assembled from pieces of shields from hundreds of dwarves who fell in battle defending their homelands. Goblinoids and giants within 30 feet who gaze upon a shield of the resolute must succeed on a Will save (DC 17) or be shaken (if they have the same or more HD than the wielder) or frightened (if they have fewer HD). This functions like a gaze attack, so the goblinoids and giants must make saves at the beginning of their turns every round unless they take measures to avoid seeing the shield of the resolute (see Chapter 8 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide for gaze attack rules).

To use this relic, you must worship Moradin and either sacrifi ce a 6th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 11 HD.
