Olidammara awards one of these nondescript rapiers when the whim strikes him. A rapier of desperate measures has only the faintest magic aura about it and seems otherwise ordinary, except for an inscription near the base of the blade: “Don’t be careful.” This +2 keen rapier becomes a +4 keen rapier if its wielder has less than half of his full normal hit points and a +5 vicious keen rapier if its wielder has less than one-quarter of his full normal hit points.

To use this relic, you must worship Olidammara and either sacrifi ce a 6th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 11 HD.
