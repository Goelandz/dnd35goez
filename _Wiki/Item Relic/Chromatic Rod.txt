Forged in hellfire itself, these iron-shod rods have fi ve dragon heads (black, blue, green, red, and white) facing outward and encircling one end. A chromatic rod can be used as a +2 morningstar with either the frost, fl aming, or shocking qualities (wielder’s choice, changed with a command word). It also has a number of spell-like abilities, each usable once per day.

• Insect plague with a 1,040-foot range, creating five adjacent swarms.
• Veil with a Will disbelief save of DC 19.
• Dominate person with a 65-footrange. A DC 17 Will save negates the effect.
• Find the path lasting 160  minutes.
• Wall of ice with a 65-foot range, covering up to sixteen 10-foot squares.

To use this relic, you must worship Tiamat and either sacrifice a 7th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 13 HD.
