It is said that Garl Glittergold gave one of these weapons to each of twelve noble families many centuries ago. 

Eight are believed to remain among the gnomes. This +2/+2 fl aming gnome hooked hammer becomes a +4 fl aming burst/+4 fl aming burst hooked hammer in the hands of a gnome. The hooked hammer of the hearthfi re automatically deals its fl aming burst damage every round to any kobold or goblinoid unfortunate enough to grasp its handle.

To use this relic, you must worship Garl Glittergold and either sacrifice a 7th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 13 HD.
