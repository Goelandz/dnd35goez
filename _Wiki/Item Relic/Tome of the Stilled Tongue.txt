This thick manuscript has a leatherbound cover with a gory decoration: a desiccated tongue nailed to the front of the book (belonging to a former cleric of Vecna who couldn’t keep her order’s secrets). Five copies are known to exist. A tome of the stilled tongue contains instructions for creating a lich’s phylactery and 2d4 wizard spells of each level 6th through 9th. It also contains 500 blank spell pages that function as those in Boccob’s blessed book.

The tome of the stilled tongue also contains directions for eldritch mental exercises designed to strengthen one’s spellcasting. Anyone who reads this section of the tome, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of six days, increases his effective caster level by 2 for purposes of determining leveldependent spell variables (such as damage or range) and for caster level checks. However, the exercises are mystically strenuous, permanently reducing the reader’s Constitution score by 2.

 To use this relic, you must worship Vecna and either sacrifice a 7th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 13 HD.
