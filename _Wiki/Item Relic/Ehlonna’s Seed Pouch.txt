 This brown fur pouch appears to hold six ordinary acorns within it when examined. But when a worshiper of Ehlonna fl ings an acorn from the pouch, she can make one of three things happen.
• Create a treant (as the changestaff spell, but the treant 
emerges from the acorn) anywhere it will physically fit.
• Create a wall of thorns (as the spell)
• Create an acorn grenade that be hurled up to 100 feet away, dealing 11d6 points of fi re damage (as the fi re seeds spell, but the damage isn’t split up among multiple acorns).

Every morning, there are six acorns in Ehlonna’s seed pouch, no matter how many were there before.To use this relic, you must worship Ehlonna and either sacrifi ce an 8th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 15 HD.
