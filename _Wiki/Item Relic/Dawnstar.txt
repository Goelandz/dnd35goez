Originally gifts from Pelor to four solars who rescued a paladin from Hell itself, each dawnstaris a +3 brilliant energy morningstar. If a dawnstar is ever sundered or otherwise broken, it explodes, dealing 200 points of damage to everything within 10 feet, 150 points of damage to everything within 20 feet, and 100 points of damage to everything within 30 feet. 

All those affected can make DC 17 Refl ex saves to reduce the damage by half. A dawnstar has hardness 8 and 8 hp.

To use this relic, you must worship Pelor and either sacrifice a 7th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 13 HD.
