This set of nonmetallic +3 wild full plate armor is a riot of red, yellow, and orange leaves sewn together by Ehlonna and presented as a gift to ObadHai. A command word causes the leaves to turn brown and scatter on the breeze—and the wearer disappears. In fact, the wearer has merged with the leaves, which appear to fl utter near the ground but are actually under the wearer’sdisembodied control. The wearer can move and interact with its environment as if it were under the effect of a gaseous form spell for up to 30 minutes.

 To use this relic, you must worship Obad-Hai and either sacrifi ce a 6th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 11 HD.
