Corellon gave the original bow of the wintermoon to the elf hero Seskaya more than two thousand years ago, but his 
clerics have since made four identical copies. This +4 frost composite longbow adjusts its pull automatically to match its wielder (allowing her to add her full Strength bonus to damage with each arrow fi red). It is considered bane to drow elves (as the weapon special ability).

 To use this relic, you must worship Corellon Larethian and either sacrifice a 7th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 13 HD.
