Lesser Powers: Continuous deathwatch, 10 ranks Intimidate (total modifier +13), cure moderate wounds 3/day.

Personality: A cudgel that never forgets speaks little except during combat, during which it reminds its wielder in stentorian tones about the transgressions of each enemy, whether witnessed personally (“That bugbear wounded Lidda most grievously”) or assumed based on creature type (“That succubus hath surely tempted many good men toward evil”). The imprecations of a cudgel that never forgets count as an attempt to demoralize an opponent with the Intimidate skill (described in Chapter 4 of the Player’s Handbook). Unless it’s healing its wielder, the cudgel that never forgets attempts to demoralize every round during its wielder’sturn. The cudgel that never forgets speaks Common, Infernal, Abyssal, and Celestial.

A cudgel that never forgets has an additional weapon quality: it remembers which foes have struck its wielder, and delivers them extra damage in retribution. If an enemy hits the wielder of a cudgel that never forgets with a weapon (including a natural weapon), the weapon thereafter has an effective enhancement bonus of +2 better than its normal enhancement bonus. It also deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against such a foe.

To use this relic, you must worship St. Cuthbert and either sacrifice a 7th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 13 HD.
