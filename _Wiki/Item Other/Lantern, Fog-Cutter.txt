This bullseye lantern has a special amber lens that allows light to reach farther through mist, fog, and smoke than that from regular lanterns. It illuminates a cone 40 feet long and 10 feet wide at the end, regardless of fog or mist, and it burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a lantern in one hand.
