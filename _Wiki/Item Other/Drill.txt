This simple hand drill bores small holes in wood, metal, or stone. As a standard action, you can use the drill to create a hole in an object if the drill can ignore the object’s hardness (see below). The hole is 1 inch deep and 1 inch in diameter. Any Search checks or Spot checks through the hole are made at a –5 penalty. Listen checks through the hole are made at a –2 penalty.

 There are three types of drills. A wood drill ignores up to 5 points of hardness when drilling. An iron drill, commonly used on metal or stone, ignores up to 10 points of hardness. An adamantine drill, used on only the most diffi cult surfaces, ignores up to 20 points of hardness. A drill that does not ignore enough hardness of an object cannot bore a hole in that object. Standard drills become dull after 20 rounds of use; masterwork drills last for 100 rounds. New bits can be purchased for 10% of the cost of the drill.
