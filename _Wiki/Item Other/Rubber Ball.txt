A bouncing rubber ball can give you an idea of what lies down a corridor. Simply throw the ball at a space or grid intersection as you would throw a splash weapon, though with a range increment of 30 feet. No matter where the ball lands, it bounces directly away from you, traveling half the distance it was first thrown. Then it lands and bounces again, covering half the distance of the previous bounce. The ball continues in this manner until it makes a bounce that would be less than 5 feet in length, at which time it stops bouncing and begins rolling. If the ball strikes a solid object, it reverses direction and continues rolling.

 Thus, you can throw a rubber ball down a corridor to see whether or not it hits a wall and returns to you. Either way, you learn something about the length of the hallway. When you throw the ball, you can also listen carefully for other cues, especially if the ball does not return. For example, if you hear a splash, you know that a liquid obstacle lies ahead.
