This hollow pole has a strong, thin cord threaded through it and twisted into a loop at the end. When looped around an animal’s neck, it provides an easy way to direct the animal while preventing the animal from moving any closer than the pole’s length. An animal training pole provides a +2 circumstance bonus on attempts to teach an animal a task.
