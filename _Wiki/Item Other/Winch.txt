This is a hand-cranked winch, plus 50 feet of hemp rope (or wire) and a small hook. To be effective, the winch must be bolted or nailed down to a secure surface. There are different “strengths” that one can purchase—the equivalent of a person with Str 18 (lift/drag 600 pounds), 20 (lift/drag 800 pounds), or 22 (lift/drag 1,040 pounds).
