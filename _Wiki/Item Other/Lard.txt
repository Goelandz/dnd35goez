Simple cooking lard can be a great aid to dungeoneers. You can spread it on the floor to make a slippery 
area similar to that created by a grease spell (PH 237). Applying lard in this manner takes 1 minute, but the coated area remains slippery for 1 hour. You can also take 1 minute to coat yourself in lard, which grants you a +5 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and on grapple checks made to resist or escape a grapple or pin. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes.
