 This is a roll of barbed steel wire designed to keep things in or out. A creature trying to cross barbed wire must make a successful Reflex save (DC 10) or take 1d3 points of damage and be tripped. A pair of thick gloves is necessary to set up barbed wire. A handler who does not have gloves needs to succeed on a Dexterity check (DC 5) each round or take 1d2 points of damage. Building a barbed wire obstacle takes 1d4+6 hours, including anchor posts.
