Adventurers often encounter ancient carvings and runes that they do not understand. A rubbing kit allows them to bring a copy of the runes back to town for an expert to translate later. The kit consists of a roll of thin paper 20 feet long and 1 foot wide, and numerous sticks of fi ne charcoal. Simply place the paper over the carvings and rub it with charcoal. Creating an accurate copy requires 1 minute for each foot of paper used (in length). Rubbing more quickly reduces the time to a full-round action for the same amount of paper, but it adds 10 to the DC of any check related to interpreting the rubbing, such as a Decipher Script check.
