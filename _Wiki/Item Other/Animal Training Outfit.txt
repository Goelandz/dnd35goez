Essentially beefed-up padded armor, this suit covers a person from head to toe in thick quilted padding, especially around the limbs. It is used as protection by those who specialize in training attack animals, such as dogs. It is very difficult to move in this outfit, so it does not make for good armor. Used as armor, it has the following statistics: armor bonus +2, maximum Dex bonus +1, armor check penalty –7, arcane spell failure 40%, speed 20 ft. (30 ft.)/15 ft. (20 ft.).
