A boot sheath is easily concealed, making it useful for those who want to appear  unarmed. Boot sheaths can hold only Small or Tiny bladed weapons. Characters attempting to conceal an item in a boot sheath gain a +4 bonus on their Pick Pocket check (opposed by either Spot or Search, depending on the situation). If the character using the boot sheath does not have ranks in Pick Pocket, noticing the boot sheath requires a successful Spot or Search check (DC 10).
