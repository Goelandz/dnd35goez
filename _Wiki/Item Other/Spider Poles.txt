This assortment of metal poles can be collapsed into a small, lightweight bundle. Each pole is hollow, 1 foot long and 3/4 inch thick. When unfolded, the poles snap into a variety of positions, forming a semirigid ladder 10 feet high or an articulated frame 5 feet square. The poles can withstand up to 200 pounds of weight before the structure collapses and is ruined.

Using spider poles as a ladder grants a +1 circumstance bonus on Climb checks. They may also grant a bonus in other situations if assembled in an appropriate manner (DM’s discretion).
