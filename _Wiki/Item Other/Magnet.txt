This magnetized bar of metal picks up small objects of ferrous metal, such as iron or steel. The magnet can lift up to 2 pounds of metal if touched to the object in question. It can also attract metal objects weighing up to one-third of a pound at a distance of 1 foot. You can tie a magnet to the end of a piece of twine and lower it into a pit to pick up objects or manipulate levers. You can also lash a magnet to the end of a pole and slide it under doors to retrieve items.
