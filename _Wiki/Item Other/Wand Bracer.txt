This metal forearm band takes up space on the body as a bracer and can hold up to fi ve wands. Thin loops of thread fi t over your fi ngers, each connected to a spring mechanism on one of the wand slots. 

If your hand is empty, you can fl ex a finger as a swift action to cause the wand of your choice to spring into your grasp. You still must activate the wand as a standard action. Replacing a wand in the sheath is tricky and requires a full-round action. Most adventurers just drop the fi rst wand to the ground (a free action) when they need a different one.
