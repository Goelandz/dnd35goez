This very tight-fitting garment is made of black silk. It is used by rogues and infiltrators when sneaking around at night. Wearing the suit grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Hide checks in conditions dark enough to grant one-half concealment or better. However, the bodysuit provides no benefit if you wear other clothing or armor, other than belts, pouches, or bandoleers, on top of it.
