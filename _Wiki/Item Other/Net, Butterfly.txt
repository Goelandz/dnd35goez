This is a slender rod with a metal hoop on one end, covered by a sack made from insect netting (see that entry, above). It’s used to capture ordinary flying insects, vermin, and small birds without harming them. It requires no proficiency to use a butterfly net, which grants a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls to capture creatures that are Tiny or smaller. Treat this as a net (see Weapons in Chapter 7 of the Player’s Handbook) in all respects, except that it is not thrown.
