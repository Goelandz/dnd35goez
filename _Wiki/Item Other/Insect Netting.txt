This is a 10-foot-by-20-foot rectangle of very light woven fabric designed to keep small insects from getting through. If properly set up, it keeps away mosquitoes, bees, and other ordinary vermin. It does not prevent monstrous vermin from getting through. See the beekeeper’s outfit under Class Tools and Skill Kits for more information.
