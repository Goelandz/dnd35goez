This device consists of two steel mirrors placed opposite each other at angles, separated by a metal tube about 2 feet in length. The periscope allows you to peer around corners without revealing your presence. Because only the end of the periscope protrudes, you can make a Hide check (with a +7 bonus) for the item to determine if the creatures you spy upon notice it. The area visible through the periscope is coneshaped and begins in the space immediately around the corner. While looking through the periscope, you take a –8 penalty on Spot checks to detect creatures not in the cone-shaped area.
