Treasured among dwarven warriors in the field, the brewmaker is a pressurized container that vaguely resembles a percolator. When water, hops, and other ingredients are added, it creates a thin beer in only a week. The taste is dreadful, but thirsty soldiers take what they can get. The Fortitude save to resist intoxication from this beer has a DC of 10 (see Alcohol and Intoxication, later in this chapter).
