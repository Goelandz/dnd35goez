Designed exclusively for second-story breaking and entering, this harness is made of pliable black leather and reduces the amount of noise made from loose metal items clanging together. It grants a +1 circumstance bonus on Climb and Move Silently checks while worn but imposes a –2 penalty on Balance, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Pick Pocket, and Tumble checks.
