This premade hemp rope ladder has two small steel grappling hooks on either end. Throwing a grappling ladder is like throwing a grappling hook, only more difficult. The Use Rope check to seat the ladder is made at a DC equal to 15 + 3 per 10 feet thrown. A DC 10 Climb check is required to scale a grappling ladder.

 The price and weight in Table 2–1 is for a 10-foot ladder, but longer ladders are commonly available. For each additional 10 feet of the ladder, add 35 gp to the cost and 6 pounds to the weight
