The most common method of delivering the effect of an alchemical weapon capsule is the weapon capsule retainer. This long leather thong, wrapped around a melee weapon or a thrown weapon (but not a projectile weapon) just at the base of the blade or striking surface, holds a thin, fitted ring sized for a single alchemical capsule. A more expensive option is the triple weapon capsule retainer, which stores three capsules rather than one. A character wielding a weapon with a triple retainer can use one, two, or all three capsules it holds as part of the same action.

 Only one weapon capsule retainer (or triple retainer) can be attached to any weapon. Attaching a weapon capsule retainer to a weapon or putting a capsule into an empty weapon capsule retainer is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Thus, filling an empty triple weapon capsule retainer requires three full-round actions.

 An alchemical weapon capsule retainer can be filled with a single dose of an injury poison. Activating the capsule coats the weapon with the poison, allowing the wielder to deliver toxic strikes with the weapon. A character using poison in this way faces all the normal perils of using poison (including accidental exposure when activating the capsule or with a natural 1 on the attack roll).
