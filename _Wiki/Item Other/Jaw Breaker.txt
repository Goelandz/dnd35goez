This wood and metal device is like a reverse thumbscrew. The torturer inserts the jaw breaker into the victim’s mouth, then turns a small wheel. As the wheel turns, two opposing plates force the victim’s mouth wider and wider, breaking teeth and eventually the jawbone. The jaw breaker can also be used on the victim in other places. Each use deals 2d4 points of damage and allows one Intimidate check. The jaw breaker must generally be removed for the victim to speak coherently.
