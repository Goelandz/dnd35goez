Many religions have holy texts or formalized prayers and rituals for use by clerics and believers. These books are about the same size and weight as spellbooks, but smaller versions are typically used by clerics who travel, whether they are adventuring across the land or visiting the sick down the street.

A compact prayer book or scripture is not a complete text, but fits inside an altar case.
