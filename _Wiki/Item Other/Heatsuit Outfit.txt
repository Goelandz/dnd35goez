Clothing designed to protect the wearer against abysmal heat, such as temperatures found around forges and volcanoes. It consists of heavy pants and coat, a specially treated leather apron, very thick mittens, a thick hood, and goggles. The heatsuit outfit prevents 3 points of normal heat damage per round (not subdual) and eliminates the –4 penalty on Fortitude saves for wearing heavy clothes (see Heat Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’S Guide). A heatsuit outfit should be worn only for brief periods of time.
