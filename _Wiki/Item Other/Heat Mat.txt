This 1-foot-by-1-foot square mat is made of heat-absorbing materials. It can withstand temperatures of up to 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit, even when a hot item is placed directly on it, and will not catch fire. The mat does get uncomfortably hot and is not suitable as a protective layer of clothing. It is mostly found in alchemists’ and wizards’ laboratories.
