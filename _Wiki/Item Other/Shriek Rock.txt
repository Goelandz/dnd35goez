Created by halfling artisans, these flat stones have carefully drilled holes that cause a loud, high-pitched “shriek” when thrown hard. This sound is as loud as a human screaming in a shrill voice. Listen checks to hear shriek rocks in flight are at DC –5, modified as normal by distance and intervening obstacles. A shriek rock has a 50% chance to be destroyed or lost when thrown.
