About two dozen assorted glass, flawed rock crystal, or clay spheres in a leather pouch. They are commonly used as toys but are also useful for checking the slope in a dungeon corridor (just set one down and see which way it rolls), or as a nondamaging alternative to caltrops. One bag covers an area 5 feet square. Creatures moving through or fighting in the area must make Balance checks (DC 15). A creature that fails is unable to move for 1 round (or may fall; see the Balance skill description in the Player’s Handbook).

The DM judges the effectiveness of marbles against unusual opponents. Creatures that are Huge or larger tend to crush the marbles into dust, while those with multiple legs, like carrion crawlers, can scramble along without falling.
