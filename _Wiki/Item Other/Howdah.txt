A howdah is a seat or box, usually with a canopy and railing, placed on the back of a Huge or larger creature. Four Medium-size riders can fit on a howdah. Ornate howdahs are status symbols for rich or noble people, but open-air versions also make excellent fighting platforms. In addition to placing occupants out of the reach of most infantry, a howdah provides one-half cover.
