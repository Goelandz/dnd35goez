An ancestor of the modern violin, the fiddle is a small, portable stringed instrument with a body shaped rather like an hourglass. Four or five strings made of gut or sinew stretch across the body, anchored by pegs at the end of a long, thin neck. The strings are played with a separate piece called the bow—a long, thin piece of wood strung with fine strands of animal hair. Fiddles vary in length between 2 feet (for Medium fiddlers) and 18 inches (for halfling and kobold fiddlers). To play a fiddle, the musician holds it horizontally, typically with the base tucked under his chin, and draws the bow back and forth across the strings.

 The fiddle is popular among bards who prefer lively dance music (reels or jigs) over serene but detached “pure” music. Though welcome almost anywhere, the fiddle is the favorite instrument of kobolds, whose clever hands mastered its fingerings ages ago. (They insist that they invented the fiddle, but other races find that claim dubious.) Kobold minstrels and halfling bards typically caper about while playing, setting their audience an example of the lively dancing their music encourages. Musicians of other races usually sit or stand to play the instrument.

Bardic Music: When used by a bard to inspire courage, a fiddle increases the morale bonus on saves against charm and fear by 1. In the hands of a bard with 5 or more ranks in Perform (dance), the morale bonus instead increases by 2.

 A bard who uses a fiddle for bardic music can cast spells while performing, but only if those spells have no somatic, material, or focus components.
