This gnome-crafted device consists of a very thin wire mesh that is tightly wrapped up into a ball roughly the size of a fist. When the ball is thrown and strikes a hard surface, it springs open, creating a flexible metal mesh wall 10 feet high and 10 feet wide (hardness 0, 5 hp). The extremely thin mesh is difficult to see (Spot check DC 20). A creature who walks or runs into the mesh must make a Reflex save (DC 15) to avoid being entangled as if by a net (see Chapter 7 of the Player’s Handbook). Once the springwall has been used in this manner, it cannot be used again.
