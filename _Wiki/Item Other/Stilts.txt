These wooden stilts strap to your legs, increasing your height by 2 feet. They require a successful Balance check (DC 5) to use effectively. You can also buy taller stilts: For each additional foot in height, increase the Balance check DC by 5 and add 10 gp to the cost. Base speed while using stilts is 20 feet (Small characters actually benefit from the longer strides). You cannot run on stilts.
