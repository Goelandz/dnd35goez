 Temple candles are ecclesiastical candles (as opposed to the small, plain, tallow candles listed as adventuring gear in the Player's Handbook). They are made of wax and are 1 to 6 feet long, averaging consistently about 3 inches in diameter. Temple candles burn for 2 hours per inch of length, which can aid in measuring the passage of time underground. A timekeeping candle is a 12-hour candle (6 inches long) inscribed to indicate the passage of hours.

A vigil candle, made of wax mingled with aromatic herbs, burns for 8 hours. A character with the Heal skill who burns a vigil candle through the night when tending an injured person gives a +1 circumstance bonus on Heal checks.
