A finder’s glass is a 3-inch-diameter circular disc of red glass set in a copper frame. It can be held in front of your eye or inserted over the aperture of a standard bullseye lantern, causing it to emit dim red light. When you look through a fi nder’s glass, you gain a +30 alchemical bonus on your Search checks to find or read marks made by fi nder’s chalk. If the glass is used in conjunction with a lantern, all creatures in the area of bright illumination gain a +20 alchemical bonus on their Search checks to fi nd or read such marks.
