Woven from several pieces of green and brown canvas, these large ponchos aid anyone trying to hide in a forest environment. The carefully chosen colors blend in with the vegetation, and the poncho’s loose shape obscures the humanoid form. Forester’s cloaks provide a +1 circumstance bonus on Hide checks made in a forest.
