Disease Descriptions
The following diseases are often encountered in seafaring environments.

Coral Scratch: Characters who take damage from contact with coral must make Fortitude saves or contract coral scratch. If a character contracts coral scratch, the hit point damage dealt by the exposure to coral does not heal naturally until the character recovers or is cured of coral scratch.

Sea Rot: Usually found in the worst sort of sargasso, sea rot is caused by contact with infected creatures. When a character takes damage from sea rot, he or she must succeed on another save, or 1 point of the ability damage becomes permanent ability drain instead. 

Sea Sores: Contracted from eating or drinking food or water of poor quality, such as that found in the stores of 
poorly provisioned ships.

Suntouch: Caused by heat damage in dead calm (see page 13). Characters reduced to 0 Wisdom by suntouch are rendered insane instead of comatose, acquiring an overpowering compulsion to immerse themselves in the sea and/or drink seawater
