This handsomely tailored cloak appears to be a cloak of Charisma +6 and actually functions as such until the wearer attempts a Bluff or Diplomacy check. At that moment and thereafter, the cloak imposes a –6 penalty on the wearer’s Charisma and makes his personality coarse and grating. Once the curse is activated, a cloak of affront can be removed only by means of a remove curse spell.
